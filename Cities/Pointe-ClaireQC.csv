Avoid Fridays at all cost. FILLED to the brim with 18-19 year old obnoxiously loud and clumsy Abbott students.

Avoid one of the bartenders as there are some that are apparently pricks and will treat you like garbage because he disagrees with you on said-and-said subject, like for instance giving a tip only if the service is appropriate. Apparently you must give a fat tip to a server (or in this case a busboy) even if the quality of the service provided was garbage. Don't believe me? Have some proof:

The flavor was good and it was a generous portion for $4.95.
My niece and I both had the Galaxy burger which is a portabello based item. We had it without the cheese since I am not a fan of vegan cheese and I asked for no aioli. The lovely young lady behind the counter insisted I try the wasabi mayo on the burger. There was way too much and I did not taste any wasabi. Not a big deal but the burger needs some crunch and is very wet to eat comfortably. Also it is served alone on a plate just a bit larger then the burger.

In the past year, they have speeded up the time that it takes to prepare the food which is much appreciated! This is a cafeteria style restaurant so you order your food and pay, and then they call out your name when your food is ready. 

I have tried a few different dishes, mainly their fries, the shiitake burger, the bowls and almost everything was delicious. The items I wasn't crazy about were the 'chicken' wings and the Gandhi smoothie. My personal favorite is a toss up between the shiitake burger or for something more filling, go with the General Copper Bowl, I don't know how they make those mushrooms to be so delicious but they just are. This is a place I keep coming back to when I want something that is filling, yet not heavy.

We used to bring large groups of pre-teens and teens after swim meets because it was easy, tasty, and vegan/allergy friendly; we'd place big orders and bring them to the pool for after practice. For my daughter and her friends, it was the cool vegan place to eat. Everyone talked about ""the Copper Branch.""

But slowly over time, our friends stopped wanting to go to this branch. Why is this? Because no fail... most of the time... something was wrong with an order (wrong bun, potatoes not cooked, piece of plastic or hair in the food, cold chilli, missing order items, food overcooked and hard)! Then the staff started to turn over rapidly (lovely people just vanished suddenly). The portions shrank in the takeout containers... the fries turned into tiny wedges that are mostly wet, mushy skin. But through it all we remained loyal because it's the only vegan restaurant in the West Island and we still had our happy memories. 

But today, our loyalty crumbled into a pit of lost hope and broken dreams... when for the umteenth time our order was cold/missing items/incorrect... and for the umteenth time we had to ask for it to be fixed while the rest of our food got cold... and for the umteenth time we got shade from yet-again-another-new-employee-with-attitude... and after going through all this drama (plus paying a crap-ton of money for three meals) we see: a teeny tiny spoonful of $1 guacamole on our cold-and-not-fully-cooked-potato-wedges.

The service was slow and not the greatest. Had to ask for water and napkins a few times because it seems like she forgot about our table. Also she spilled my salad dressings and I was waiting for her to bring a replacement and she never did until I asked.
So let's get down to the food!!!!
Calamari were not bad at all and they had a nice spicy mayo sauce with them. Wings were out of this world good and I was very happy about that because I am picky about my wings. My son had the ribs and he really enjoyed it. We also had the classic burger and it was very big and it was good as well. My mom had the fish ans chip and she liked it a lot. I decided to try the filet mignon brochettes and they were cooked perfectly. The only downfall is when you take the salad instead of the soup for your table d'hôte option you end up with again another salad in your main meal. I love salad but that is a bit much.

I have been working near this restaurant for the last year. So, I have eaten their many times recently. 

So, for breakfast they have a standard special which is like $5. So it's good value and tastes as expected. 

Lunch time I have most often the burgers , fries and beer special which is $13. It's all very standard and I have gone back many a time for this special. 

On one occasion I had the hot chicken sandwich and the ""Octoberfest special."" Both were satisfactory. 

For me to award 4 stars the food would have to taste better. I would do 3.5 (alas). 

I like the decor being in an old stone and wood house so it feels very nice in the winter. In the summer they have pretty killer patio (for the West Island)

So, it's a good bet! Enjoy!

Yes, the service was good and our waitress was kind and polite.. But not more than that. We went on a Friday, and it was also a clear sign that they were short staffed. An Irish Pub on a Friday short staff.. Not at all a good impression. Keep in mind this location recently had a shooting during a fight on a weekend night.
We had ordered fish and chips(We were told that's their specialty) and a French onion soup.
The French onion soup tasted like salty thick water with colour. The bread which the soup should have, was not toasted, therefore it was a soggy old tasting piece of bread. The onions were not fully cooked, therefore they tasted crunchy. The cheese was a lump, not beautifully melted as it should be.
The Fish and chips, were incredibly greasy. Yes, I know it's fried food. The level of greasiness was simply absurd. It absorbed through the paper and dripped a bit from the one piece of fish. Yes, just one piece. The batter on the fish was slipping off each time it was cut, to only realize how much grease there was in this dish. The fries were Ok, if you like fries that taste as if they were warmed up and ,not freshly made.
Luckily our waitress never asked us how our food was, nor if we needed anything else. Otherwise, I would have shared these exact comments to her. I know it's not her fault.

The atmosphere is nice, surprisingly not noisy even though the bar is big (probably due to the very good placements of heavy duty wooden walls that diminish the sound), good quality furniture and appropriate spacial management for seating, very welcoming bar and a friendly staff.

The food is also decent. It's at McKibbin's where I fell in love with sweet potato fries! There is also a stage for the occasional bands. I've heard two play which were mediocre at best. Surprisingly a lot of security but I understood the need after I've seen a bad drunk threatening to get the Russian mafia to shoot the pub up after getting thrown out of a bar.

I've never tried The Rim Reaper Challenge as I already passed 20 minutes under a sink with tears rolling down my cheeks after trying Cage Aux Sports' 9-1-1 hot wings and didn't wish to permanently damage my taste buds but it seems quite fun if you think you're up to it!

They managed our large parties beautifully and we weren't served flat beer this time. Perhaps going on a less busy day, such as a Tuesday (both visits were on a Tuesday), is ideal.

Update: Manager doesn't know how to handle serving flat watered down Guinness.
I had to update my review based on two new experiences, specifically the one on Friday, February 3rd, 2017. We had a wonderful server who handled our large party very well, but the way the manager handled a situation regarding bad beer left us all a little frustrated. So my original four star review has gone down to a three.

Three of my friends ordered Guinness. Two of them got theirs several minutes before the third and there was a clear difference in taste. The third was delicious like a Guinness should be, but the two earlier ones tasted like water had been added to them and there wasn't even a centimetre of foam when they arrived at the table. When we informed the waitress she spoke with the manager who said they didn't change the barrel so my friends were stuck with the terrible pints they received. The waitress tried once more and brought one of my colleague's glasses for the manager to try. This is where things get worse.

She brought back the glass and asked my friend to try it to see if it was better. My friend not wanting to make a scene or to cause a fuss said yes. She said the manager had simply changed the glass. The manager LITERALLY just poured the terrible beer from one glass to another thinking it would make it better. Now if the glass was the issue and it had affected the taste I would give this pub a lower score because that means the sanitation must be terrible. But it wasn't, so I will leave it at 3 stars for now. The manager did the same for the second friend, but upon learning of the disgusting supposed fix they both admitted to her it was still terrible. Everyone was still able to taste the difference between the two bad pints and the good one. The waitress was genuinely apologetic because there was nothing she could do. So dear manager of that day, when your clients tell you that the beer is terrible and there is a visual difference between the beers maybe you should give them two new beers and not simply switch glasses. Also, did I mention my friends had to pay for the undrinkable beer?

Also, do not order the regular nachos. I've tried them on two occasions and it's simply dry nacho chips with barely any toppings. Both times we left the plates half eaten.

Of course, I will continue attending this establishment as it is the closest watering hole to my work. I just hope my future experiences are akin to the first two times I've gone there and unlike the last two times.

TLDR: Great beer selection, hearty food, and great service.

Great place to go to after work, but it fills up fast with big parties. The servers are sweethearts and will do their best to accommodate you.  They have a lot of brews and ciders to choose from, and they make cocktails if you aren't a fan of beers. The food is also good, but it does take some time which they kindly warn you about on the menu.

The Fish n' chips are consistent (7.5 on 10)- so I'm rarely dissapointed. They tend to be on the normal to heavy side of coating on the batter to give you an idea. As for the fries, they're solid too. I've been changing it up lately, with the bbq-beer-marinated beef nachos. Very fun and tasty to eat in this pub. The size is very generous- good enough for 3 adults as a main course- easily. Don't make the mistake of ordering as an appetizer unless you're in a big group. The beer selection has the standard staples you would expect at a pub.

Even though this location is in a strip-mall (you can hit a bookstore, grocery store and toy store when you're there!), when you step inside the door, you are transported into a true irish pub.  Both nights (a Monday and Wednesday) were packed with people - young/old, couples/singles).  

But this is Yelp - which is about food - and this place solidly deserves 4 stars (if not more).  Monday night, I had the special - corned beef sandwich, cole slaw and fries.  REALLY REALLY good. I have yet to figure out the difference between ""Montreal Smoked Meat ""and ""Corned Beef"".  In fact, they call fries ""chips"" and the slaw was ""creamed cabbage"".  Call me an ignornant American, but it was still wonderful.  The second night, I had the Shepards Pie, which was equally as good.  It was odd that it was served with a salad.

One star for takeout. Avoid at all costs. We were a gang and ordered wings, guiness beef nachos, chowder, and fish/chips to go for the Heat vs Lakers... bad idea. The chowder was put in an foldover, aluminum base with cardboard cover (the type you would use for chicken and rice or pasta) and OF COURSE the liquid went all over the other food. They have to be retarded to use this packaging for soup- my god- not exactly air tight guys! Ok so the soup thing was bad, and it just went downhill from there... the nachos were packaged with no thought either. Four portions worth of nachos were bundled into layers of aluminum foil into the form of a silver canon ball à la Jack Sparrow. So the warm beef softened all the chips into soggy crap. Also, not enough salsa for a to-go order. Anyway, it's clear they have no to-go experience and don't care about investing in real packaging to protect their food integrity.

Then decades later rediscovered this now truly retro late 50's early 60's vintage neighbourhood pizzeria. Where the menu has not changed, same husband and wife team still serve up good food at an 80's (inflation eh, lol) price. They're open Monday to Saturday evening, closed on Sundays.

The pizza, all dressed (16"" $19.00) is our usual, is good almost great. The sauce is nice without any hint of acid, the cheese is real mozzarella and stretches like the pizzas of old. The (circa 60's) challenge of lifting a slice was getting it to your face without the multiple strings of cheese getting in the way. Oh those were the days my friend we thought they'd never end.
 
 This evening (16th Aug. 2013) I went in to grab a couple of cheese burgers, they are the real deal and have not changed since the place opened in the mid 50's. Two all dressed cheese burgers and one size only fry (to split) for a whopping $10.05 tax included. That is a very hard deal to match.

The burger is fresh and handmade, the meat unfortunately is not spiced or seasoned but that was the way it was. Try eating a McMystryBurger without all the condiments and you'll see the difference between commercial crap and a local pizza joint that has been around forever.

Now the fries are nothing to talk about and get a 1 star if that but when in roam .etc. the fries of the 60's where far superior and I don't understand why they've gone the commercial route. Although LaFleur fries are a lot of work but can be bought commercially and taste like the real deal, less the peeling, soaking and blanching.
Travel back in time as you take a seat and just enjoy what was a much simpler time. The food is a three and improvements could be made, sure. But with the good food, awesome prices and the super for real retro time machine feel it is a five in my heart and that is all that really matters. Also the place is not dirty it is well maintained by both husband and wife. It is very old and the pictures and signs are faded but it is otherwise very clean and so is the kitchen, I've seen it. Unfortunately, the old time table jukeboxes don't work but the contents of what we used to listen to is still there, flip through time, it's a blast.

This is Saturday night at 7pm and there is only one table being occupied. We were told to sit anywhere. The waitress and waiter were not friendly nor made themselves seen. We ordered the Cantonese chow mein -which had mostly noodles and was limited in the  amount of shrimp and chicken . This dish was good. My wife order the teriyaki chicken which comes with spring roll,white rice ,salad  , and 4 teriyaki chicken skewers. The chicken was over cooked and was not eatable. The spring roll was to crispy (over fried ) and the filling was dried out. They brought one plum which  the outside was sticky. I ordered the Shenzhen shrimp meal . It came with a salad , white rice and Shenzhen shrimp. The shrimp were nice size and was not fried . The dish overall was good. The waiter finally came after 15 minutes to see if wanted anything else. We told him the chicken was over cooked and uneatable 3.5 skewers left on plate . He said ok and walked away . He returned with our bill totally playing stupid in not understanding what we were talking about. My wife was still hungry as her main meal the chicken was unbeatable - they did not care and told me that it fresh chicken . Bottom line that the service was bad and the food other then the chicken was good. Sorry but when you challenge a customer on his dissatisfaction of your product clearly you do not listen nor care .
We would have given them a second chance but their bad attitude does not warrant us for a retry .

Jump ahead a few years: My sister's surprise party was held there on June 2nd. The food was outstanding, and the service was great. 
Paul was really looking forward to going back. 
We returned tonight on one of our rare dates. 

The food was exactly as bad as our first meal there. My veal didn't taste fresh, the side vegetables were doused in some salty spices and the pasta was DRY. Seriously. It was supposed to be pasta aglio e olio, except they were just dry lol. Someone forgot something. 
My husband ordered the same dish he had ordered last week: veal tortellini with rosé sauce, but it didn't taste the same at all. It tasted like frozen noodles...

Let's be honest. I can understand the food being a miss. No big deal I suppose. It happens. However how it's dealt with makes all the difference in the world. 
I told the waiter the quality wasn't even close to what it had been for my sister's party and that it was unfortunate, especially after it had been so great last week!  He replied that he'd speak to the manager. 

The waiter came back a while later and said, ""I spoke to the manager. There's not much we can do. I guess we'll keep an eye on it. But that's about it"". 
I just said, ""ok"". But what I was really thinking was, "" seriously?!"".

We had dinner at L'Academie in Pointe Claire.  I had never been there before but Jess has been there several times and she loves it.

All I wanted was the escargot but did not think many people would be getting the appetizers so I refrained- with much regret.  Jess let me try one of her escargots and they were amazing.

Ant got the Mussels and I got the Atlantic Salmon.

I must say, I was not impressed and Ant was not a fan either.  It was the first time I did not ask for a doggie bag and I think that is an indication of my feelings toward the meal.  Jess got a dessert for free since it was her birthday but even that was... odd.  They said it was ice cream but it looked more like whipped cream with crumbs put on it.  It was strange.

This restaurant is BYOW and I am glad we brought a bottle to share.  Although, I must say that the atmosphere is pretty great.  It seems to be too formal for there to be the big screens they had but I am happy that I was able to see the hockey score in the background.  The staff is very friendly and I even ran to an old coworker of mine which was a nice surprise.

Overall, I am happy I had the company I did but I don't think I'll be returning to this restaurant.  To each their own though!  If you go there, I hope you have a better experience and let me know!

All of the waiters were very professional, and a shout out to the awkward water boy that dropped by a few times. Billy was the name of our server, a very personable young man who very much deserves a raise. 

Okay, so maybe this place is a bit better than a Jack Astor's. We're seated in the window, and are tended to quite regularly. The bread basket that we received was quite small, but after a few times filling it, they figured out that we're bread-eaters. It began to come back full to the brim. The white baguette wasn't sliced all the way through, the outside was crusty, the crumb was perfect, and it was slightly warmed. No wonder I ate so much of it. The whole grain roll was great as well. I'm not a big fan of birdseed bread, but it was quite exceptional. Over dinner, I get more of a background on this place. It was apparently an offshoot of a bunch of chefs that went to school together. So far, this is the best example of everything I learned in school, they're doing everything right. 

Eventually our meals came, a risotto and my chicken fillet in pink peppercorn sauce. His plate of risotto was filled with mushrooms and looked quite appetizing. My meal was a full one. The plate was stylized, and for the better. Two large chicken breasts that were cooked to perfection. Perfectly moist coated in a pink peppercorn cream sauce. Oh, it was heavenly. To add to this, tasty roasted potatoes, a carrot with the green top, three asparagus, and some shredded gourd of some kind. It was very delicious. 

I only have one negative aspect of this dish. Not that there wasn't enough food, because I had to have Uncle Larito help me finish it, but that the peppercorns were overpowering. I understand that it's a pink peppercorn sauce, but the same powerful taste could have come from some crushed peppercorns rather than a bunch of whole ones. While whole peppercorns are nice, there were so many that I had to scrape them off of my chicken and I found it quite unpleasant to bite into them. Every bite had at least five whole peppercorns if I had not scraped them off. It really put me off trying to finish my dish. 

Larito's risotto was exceptional. I am not a pasta fan, but this was perfectly spiced and had very full flavours. Good job!

Over coffees, which were fine, we ordered dessert. I ordered the carrot cake and Larito decided to talk to Billy about which of the desserts came recommended. The carrot cake and chocolate mousse were at the top, next down was the crème caramel and the crème brulee, and finally, the cheesecake. 

Larito decided to go with the brulee. It was quite well done, and was house-made. The sugar was torched perfectly and was made with the richness of extra yolks. It was a little less sweet than I would have liked, but Uncle Larito was satisfied with it. I am sceptical about the cake slice that I received. I adore carrot cake. The cream cheese icing, the moist carrot cake with the abundance of spices that float about the cake is like heaven on Earth. Alas, this cake was not satisfactory. The plating was quite nice, it came with a treble clef drawn on the plate in crème anglaise with the slice next to it. 

The carrot cake consisted of four thin layers of orange cake that were surrounded by a unicorn mayonnaise icing of some kind. There was no cream cheese flavour, not even the acidity to suggest that it had once been cream cheese. The orange cake had no spices, it was just masquerading as carrot cake. If I had to guess, I would assume that this is a LaRocca cake or something similar. 

I would recommend investing in a better bakery to supply your desserts or at least try to make them in house. If this cannot be done, please remove the cake out of the fridge before service. Also, plating with crème anglaise wasn't beneficial to the plate. While the colours matched, this is only half of the battle. Please, choose something that isn't creamy, even a nice tangerine sauce, a spiced brandy sauce would have been wonderful, or even some spice to your crème anglaise would have been quite nice. I was also a little worried as to if the sauce was really a crème anglaise, or if it was the uncooked remnants from the crème brulee. In which case, if it was, I do hope that the eggs were pasteurized in some way. I actually didn't eat the sauce due to the fact that it might not have been safe for me to eat. 

All in all, I had a wonderful experience. I would return, and I do hope that this chain makes its way to Ontario. The decor was fabulous, the menu was well planned, and the staff was amazing. It was a little too expensive for my taste, even though what we did get (minus the dessert) was well worth the price. Great job, L'Academie.

The waiter took my plate away and said , don't worry it's on the house , can I offer you something else. I thought , how sweet of the gentleman to offer it on the house ! So I decided to take him up on his offer and try something new. Then we get the bill, they charged us for the original meal, that was a lot more expensive. Upon telling the manger that I was told it would be on the house, they still charged me for the second meal (which wasn't much better), and when I told the manger how upset I was that she was making me pay at all , considering my food was rotten , she had nothing to say , and Continued to charge me.

I had the opportunity to try for the first time in November last year. The restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful, it is huge and it can fit a lot of people. The whole vibe of the restaurant is very chic and I'm sure older people might love that vibe. 

As for the food, I was very disappointed. This place is WAY overpriced. They have a ""table d'hôte"" menu where they add a salad to your plate. The salad is very disappointing. It consists of greens, a few carrot slices on the side and a cheap sauce that I feel isn't even made by the restaurant. It was very dry and lukewarm. As for the main plate, I had the lamb square. Again, very average for the price. It was dry, and the sauce was all pepper-tasting, not good at all. The potatoes were dry as well, and the vegetables they put as a side were tasteless. The portions are also pretty small for what you're paying. My friend had the sirloin steak and said it was dry as well as bland.

The dessert might've been the only thing that I've enjoyed during this meal. I tried the crème brûlée and it was very good, perfectly crispy on the top.

The waiters were very nice and patient considering the fact that we were a big group (20+ people). The food was very questionable though.

The food is pretty mediocre, the ambience is neither here nor there, and the service is chaotic. A good place if you're going out with a large group and want something mildly exotic for a reasonable price. Not a very good place for a romantic dinner a deux.

The sushi is not as horrible as Sushi St-Jean across the street, but also not the rich flavour experience of Wi Sushi down the road. The rice is a bit dry; the ingredients and seasoning are unremarkable; the fish and seafood are quite fresh though.
And if you're not into sushi but your friends drag you there, they have teriyaki chicken and beef, as well as other standard oriental staples like General Tao and peanut butter dumplings. If not, they also have wings and fries.

The ambience is a little confusing. They look like they were trying to go for an upscale setting, but they also have giant screens broadcasting sports games. The crowd is mostly families with kids and large groups of friends.

The service was very disorganized.
We were missing utensils and extra order forms on our table; it took forever for anyone to pick up our order; we never got our tea until we asked for it, and even then we were given cups of it unlike the teapots other tables seemed to be getting; they messed up the amounts we ordered and brought us way too much; also brought us items we had crossed off the order; when it came time to pay, we left a credit card in the booklet, but were told to pay at the front, and when we got there were told to wait at our table for them to come around with the machine, then we saw them wave other people to pay at the front, which turned to be where you pay.

I was part of a group of three and between the three of us we left an adequate tip based on the service we received. When we went to pay, we got a very snide look from the server which could've been let go, whatever... 

As we went to leave we were approached by a server and their manager who demanded to know why no tip was left, accosted by a million questions - we said based on the service we received we felt what we had left was more than adequate. She then went on to say, ""Well, my servers will not get paid enough then"" To which we had to reply ""Why don't you simply pay your servers the correct wage?"" 

We then said fine, whatever, we'll add on a few extra dollars. Without asking, she then proceeded to refund the INCORRECT BILL so we could pay it over again. The friend who's bill got mistakenly refunded then simply paid again, this time excluding the tip we had given previously due to his horrendous treatment. What kind of place will APPROACH YOU AND DEMAND MORE MONEY? If you expect an amazing tip, provide AMAZING service, or at the very least make great food.

When it came to paying for our meals, their machine was shutting down, and when I went to pass my card twice, it said it wasn't approved.

Uncaring as to why the machine was not working, and a little curt, but nonetheless I complied and paid in cash.

Once I asked for the change back (I tip the amount with the change leftover, and always ask for it back, even though I do plan on leaving a tip), she asked if I wanted the full amount. I have to admit I was already in a tempered mood due to our previous encounter, but I still believe this to be rude. I asked for the full amount, and she said ok. They she took a look at the bill and stated that if she gave back more than $4.00 it would be less than 15%. I nodded and agreed and stated that is till wanted the full change back.

The ordering process was very easy. Antoine (the owner) walked us through the menu and was extremely flexible with all the options and variations we wanted. We then placed our order and picked it up from the pickup location.

Food presentation: the food was extremely well packed and secured within the containers so we were not worried about transportation. The presentation itself was amazing (as you can see from the pictures). My guests found them extremely professional (FYI I requested the aluminum containers for easier handling and disposing)

The taste: IT WAS DELICIOUS. Everyone stopped having a conversation because the food was soooo good. The meat and chicken were so juicy, the garlic was extremely well balanced, perfect taste with very little after taste or bad breath. The rice was cooked to perfection and the salad dressing was very good. My guests were fighting to take leftovers!

Overall this catering service is:
Taste: 10/10
Price:10/10

This is a catering service that prepare a good selection of Canadian and Middle Eastern inspired hot meals by the kilo.  They are served in aluminum pans.

The ordering process is easy, but, you have to do your own homework first: How many people do you intend to serve, adults vs children vs big eaters vs those with small appetites vs diet limitations etc... and then figure out how much food in each category you need by the kilo.

1) Go through menu online
2) Email or call to place order with your food choices, pickup date and time (don't worry, the phone number is legit lol since it has a non-Montreal area code; they cater long distance events too e.g. Ottawa)
3) Pay by email transfer - don't bother with a scientific ""secret"" question and answer as this vendor is setup to receive direct payment bypassing security questions - you can trust them!
4) Show up at the pickup location at the date and time agreed on.  (Pickup: 2001 Des Sources Blvd - Pointe Claire H9R5Z4 - Loading dock Black door # 1 Near the ramp, as at Oct 20, 2018).

We ordered chicken and rice, kafta and potatoes, spinach and cheese cannelloni, meat lasagna, vegetables cous cous with no chicken - served on time, and piping hot, and securely wrapped and boxed (a great job if I may so!).  The flavours were wonderful and the convenience of having food prepared for you is such a convenience when hosting an event!

The representative (owner?) Antoine was such a pleasure to speak with - by phone or email, he was so patient to walk me through the process A - Z and was always readily available to answer questions.

Wow was it amazing - compared to some of the other Middle Eastern restaurants that I always go to this dip blew them out of the water.

Everything was extremely reasonably priced and I was able to save my wallet when it was anticipating a rough Christmas and New Years season! The delivery was insanely prompt, I ended up receiving all the dishes right before the party started.

I first went with that same someone to the wonderfully decorated, spacious and heated upper level terrace to wait for her family members and our table reserved for 6:15pm on a saturday night last weekend. (How is that for precision!)
The waitress (now you she was a girl, because server isn't specific enough) brought me a white beer and a french menu so that I could decide what to eat later, when the round pager would start illuminating like a flying saucer.
She was polite, courteous and very helpful, like all of the staff I had the pleasure of coming in contact with on this wonderful evening at The Keg (btw, the name always made me think it was a dirty bar for (dirtyer) college kids to go get wasted on weekends. Now I know it is the complete opposite. Who ever thought of naming an upscale steakhouse ""The Keg"")but I digress...

So once the rest of the pack arrived, the pager lit up and we descended and got seated at a wonderful banquette for 5.

Our men waiters were all sporting beards which I asked (jokingly, I was at my second beer) if it was a prerequisite to work here. (Like in an episode of Seinfeld where Elaine thinks Monk's resto only hire one type of waitress...) maybe it was a coincidence,  maybe I'm on to something! 
Ok, so...the food?
Best fillet mignon I've had in a long time (I grew up on them!), wrapped in bacon and topped with blue cheese!?! Now that was the bomb! (meaning it was an outstanding combination of flavours/delicious)
I ended the meal with a $3 ice cream and brownie dessert hoping it would have been just small enough, but to me it seemed HUGE! Definitely not complaining. 
So to sum it all up, if you are very picky and demanding and you know what you like and how you like it, (like I am) this restaurant can and will deliver.

While the drinks and food were great as usual, I had to give lower my rating because the service was shocking. I wanted to only bring it down to a 3-star rating, but considering the level of inappropriateness that we witnessed, I had to go with a 2 star.

Please note that my group and I were sitting in the bar area, which we acknowledge and respect can get quite busy. Regardless, the waitress would come by and try to take away our unfinished drinks so that we would order more. Oddly, trying to get their attention was very difficult especially when trying to get the bill. However, the real offender that forced me to write this review was how they handled sending us food we didn't order to our table.

The waitress placed a plate of calamari at our large table, which some people slowly started to munch on. We were all sharing platters, and no one realized that no one ordered calamari. The waitress then came back and informed us that it was another table who ordered it and took it away. The problem is that she then took the partially eaten plate to the other table who ordered it. We were all in shock. Even if we knew one person at the other table, you do not take a partially eaten meal from one table to another. You bring them a new plate.

This is why I had to bring down my rating from a four to a two. Whenever we organize a work 5a7 we go to the Keg, but after seeing such unsanitary behaviour we may have to reconsider our go-to place as it's hard to order food after witnessing that.

Very spacious and a good ambiance. It was pretty busy, we waited maybe 20 minutes at 6pm on a Thursday to be seated. 

I found the service to be excellent, the appetizers very good, but the main meals were so-so. They serve warm, delicious bread, which was great. The apps we ordered were also very good, and served with another type of bread, which was amazing! The apps were garlic butter shrimp (cooked perfectly) with cheese and mushrooms stuffed with crab (this was probably the highlight of the night!) 

For our main meals, neither of us ordered steak, so maybe it would have been better if we had. We ordered two dishes which we shared. The first dish was seared sesame tuna. It was served cold over a coleslaw with a sesame dressing. The tuna itself was very good! The salad was not very substantial. I don't think that the dish would have been filling enough had we not ordered appetizers. 

The other dish we had was like a chicken 'surf and turf.' It was chicken served with shrimp, scallops, and crab, over mashed potatoes, and asparagus. The mashed potatoes and asparagus were very good, but the chicken was really nothing special; rather bland actually. The shrimp seemed over cooked, surprising, because the appetizer shrimp were perfect. The crab was okay. I didn't try the scallops, so I can't comment.

Where did we find the answer, well none other than Yelp of course.  Located close by and what appeared to be a very nice environment we settled on The Keg.  

When walking up to the restaurant, which is attached to a mall, we were not expecting too much on the inside.  However, when you enter you are immediately reminded that you are dinning at a steakhouse. With tall ceilings and dark lighting, the mood was set for a relaxing and intimate dinner.  The décor was modern without being overdone.  The restaurant felt cozy and inviting while have a small touch of masculinity. 

We sat down at our table and our server promptly came by and got our drink order.  My wife got the white sangria and I a local hefeweizen. Both of which were remarkable and tasty.  Not being hungry enough we just got meals.  While waiting for our food we received complimentary bread.  It was good but noting to write home about.  When my chicken came to the table it made my mouth water and I was eager to eat it.  The chicken itself was cook perfectly with a crispy skin and a juicy and succulent center.  Served over a bead of asiago rice with a sweet chili sauce over the top.  The flavors overall were great, a nice play between textures and the sweet and spicy.  Overall, a very good dish and something I would recommend to anyone who is looking for something a little lighter but not lacking any flavor.

We were not impressed when they told us we had be out by 9pm. We understand but do not push us before we even get seated. Not a good start. We started out with house fresh mixes salads. Well when you find the core of the head of lettuce that is brown and cut into your salad sure displays poor quality control and was turn off. The server did take the brown core pieces away. A few minutes later the manager did show up at our table . He was apologetic  but then he start making excuses. The steaks arrived which mine was suppose to be medium but was partially on a rare side and was not hot but warm. But the bake potato was cold . At this point our server was no where to be found . A few minutes into our meal the manager did come by to see if everything was ok. I did ask him to  touch my potato to see first hand that the potato was cold . He was hesitant at first but when he did touch it he immediately agreed and stated that this was unacceptable . He said he would get me a hot potato. When he did return he stated that he was not happy with our experience and was taking it off the bill. That was the right way to handle the matter . That being said the kitchen staff and chef should understand when someone is spending a lot of money for a steak and salad they do expect everything to be perfect and not sloppy.

Great 5 a 7 deals of well-made cocktails and food. You can't go wrong with the cocktails. I've tried the dark and stormy, tequila cinnamon, bloody mary, and much more and they were all well balanced. If you prefer virgin drinks, their Virgin Mary has quite the kick to it. Their wine and beer lists are also nice. 

Let's discuss the food:
Their nachos are vibrant in colour and flavour, and I recommend topping them with chicken.
The fried calamari comes with fried red bell peppers and fried slices of jalapeno for some extra flavour.
Their house salad is great for people who are peckish but would rather drink their calories than eat them.

Searched for the best restaurants in the area and consistently the Keg was rated the highest with the best reviews.   My research was strengthened when work colleagues gave a glowing review of having gone the previous night.  They raved about the service and food and they were right.  

The Keg was convenient to our hotel and we lucked out with good parking. We worried as everyone told us we needed a reservation but we just beat the rush and were able to walk in with no worry. 

Having been our first visit to this popular Canadian chain, we put heavy stock in the recommendations of their servers. Our server was perfect, honest and gave really great menu advice. 

I went with the Sirloin Oscar. It's an 8oz sirloin cut served with shrimp, scallops, asparagus, and Béarnaise sauce, at ($37 CDN / October 2018).  Pricey yes, but a great portion and worth every penny.  

We enjoyed a great Cabernet, and a small sample of their mini desserts.  

The restaurant was extremely busy and filled up with a long wait after we were seated.  It was a mix of business groups holding 30-person events and many many birthdays.  It seemed as if everyone was walking in with flowers and gifts to celebrate at this special place. 

Huge thanks to all the hostesses, servers, managers and heart of the house cook staff that made our first visit a very special one where we can't wait to return. 

It's so hard to believe that a chain can provide such quality experience, products and services and be consistent.  Having finally visited I'm now not surprised at this brand's popularity.

But here I am, my second time around at the Keg.
I must say that it was on a saturday night at 6pm.
We were 5 people waiting for a table in the dining room.
 They told us it would take about 90 min.
Nothing wrong with that, don't mind waiting for a table while drinking at their beautiful bar.
But the people I was with accepted a table at the bar instead, being that the wait would be 10 min. instead of 90...

Things were looking up when they offered us a table in the dining room because someone else preferred to be in the bar to watch the game,  even better!

But after 45 min of waiting and all these promises,  here comes the same guy telling us now that it was all a mistake on his part, that we couldn't be seated in the dining room area!?
So the table we initially had accepted at the bar was gone and so as the other one in the dining room! 

So he offers us a round of drinks and appetizers. 
And promises us the next bar table available. 

What a fiasco!

Fridays and Saturdays are quite complicated days to get a table here.
I think you need to reserve before 6pm, otherwise, good luck!

The booth tables at the back of the bar are not meant to have a full dinner on, way too small, very akward and annoying for everyone. 
Can't fit much on there, especially if we all have drinks and water (which apparently you need to ask for, the days of bringing water all around seem to be gone, here)

It was a Wednesday night and surprisingly, pretty crowded. We put our names on the waitlist and waited for about 10 minutes or so and then were seated. 

The server was great, very friendly and knowledgeable. She mentioned that she was from the US, so we all bonded over that briefly. We had drinks/wine and ordered our entrees. We ordered the tuna tartare and calamari as appetizers, and both were absolutely delicious! I ordered the 7 oz. filet mignon, which was bacon-wrapped, and the twice-baked potato and a Caesar salad for my main course. Y'all...this was the best filet I've ever had! The bacon really gave it good flavor although I didn't eat the actual bacon, and the potato and salad were equally good.

Unfortunately, this is NOT one of them.
We were a party of 5 and made reservations for Thursday July 16, 2015.  We arrived on time and the restaurant was not very busy.
The hostess didn't even bring us to our table.  She walked us towards the patio and pointed to the table from inside to let us know where our table was.
The waitress Darlene B came to our table to take our drink order.  She was not particularly pleasant and somewhat abrupt in communicating with us.  
Darlene took our food order and brought it to our table.
The food was mediocre and not hot at all.  
Myself and one guest shared a Tortellini - it was not hot and a little dry - it could have used more sauce.
My husband had the fish and chips.  It was mostly batter with very little fish, the French fries were terrible and the meal also was not hot.
My friend had the southern fried chicken which was cold and not very tasty.  
My other friend had a salad and this was apparently good.
Since one of us has previous restaurant experience it was decided not to return any of the food back to the kitchen as there are concerns throughout the restaurant industry about returning food.
At NO time during the meal did Darlene come and ask if we like our food.  (I suspect she already knew the food was not very good)
Darlene came and cleared the table and overheard one of us mention dessert - only at this point did she ask us if we wanted any dessert.
She brought the dessert menus and didn't return for quite a long time to see if we wanted anything.  As it turned out we did not order anything.
Then we waited for another very long time for our bills.  (We had asked for 2 bills)
Darlene noticed that I was paying by credit card and proceeded to set up the machine and pointed out that she was including 15% for tip. 
As it turns out I usually leave 20%.  However, due to the poor service and food my intention was to leave only 10%.  Once I saw that I was being manipulated into a 15% tip I choose ""other"" instead of ""ok"" for the 15% and ended up leaving nothing.
Darlene TOLD me that I had not left a tip and that I had pressed the wrong button.  When it appeared to her that it may have been a mistake she offered to ""fix"" it.  
My friend that was paying the other bill with cash ended up leave her just under 10% of her bill.  Very generous in my opinion as it was certainly not deserved.

I don't believe in reviewing after only one visit, so after 3, I figure that I can make a value judgement.  The food does not taste fresh.

It tasted as if it had come out of a bottle.  The crab sliders were, well - mushy and again, lacked a freshness.  

It seems as if the restaurant is having an identity crisis; unsure as to what type of fare it should be offering and covers the gamut, thinly.  When you try to do too much, as a restaurant, more often than not, all the dishes suffer.  This is the case with Calistoga.  I also found the venue a bit too small for the volume of the music.  

One of the three visits was with a larger group; the service was slow and inattentive.  Glaringly so.  The restaurant had been notified of the group's intent and even with this notice, the staffing for our table consisted of 1 lone server who did his best but was overwhelmed.

At first, while watching them, I was worried that only the top puffs would get their icing sauces and the bottom would be plain. But nope! It leaked through onto all of the layers. It was good ^_^

I still remember the first time going to Mr. Puffs in Laval. Now I don't need to travel far from my mom's house to this location.
 
Location: Blvd St Jean - Not a lot of parking here. West end of the city. And the traffic is terrible since they are working on St Jean. 4/5 stars
 
Atmosphere: It has a fast food style ordering. You go to the counter, order what you want and wait do pick up your food. It's a small hole in the wall with a few tables inside the building. A nice size patio as taken a few parking spots, but I guess that's a sacrifice they took in behalf of their customers 3/5 stars
 
Service: Well no real service here since you order over the counter and pickup your own food. The girl over the counter did have attitude. Hey if you don't enjoy the work you do, time to find something else. 2/5 stars
 
Food: This is mainly a dessert place with deep fried goodness, milkshakes, ice coffees, ice cream and cold drinks. They did have snack style dishes like spanakopita. So don't come here expecting a good meal. The puffs were good, but you need to eat them while they are hot. Once they get cold, the tastes changes. Please don't mistaken this place as a cream puff place, because if you do, you'll be greatly disappointed. 3.5/5 stars
 
Price: Not bad, $18 for a box 50, which comes to 0.36 pee puff. That's the only thing we ordered, so I can't really comment on the other stuff they have on the menu. But it was well priced. 4/5 stars
 
Overall: I will be back to buy some more. It's a on the way home to Toronto. But I think they need to ensure the front staff enjoys their job. Is there a way to keep the puffs warm? Either by microwave or oven? And if so, they should put instructions on their box. 3/5 stars

Don't get me wrong. Toronto has great food. But, the city's lame excuse of a bagel is embarrassing, cringe-worthy even.

This location has an oven making the bagels fresh constantly, a small store front selling various jarred and pre-made items (as well as fresh bagels of course) and a 'restaurant' (cafe?) in the back half serving food.

Lots of space to sit and eat in the store.  Parking is adequate but I could see lunch hours becoming really busy. 

Food:
1) smoked salmon bagel - one on an everything bagel, one on a sesame seed bagel.  Comes with smoked salmon, cream cheese, capers, onions, lemon.  

2) smoked meat bagel - had it with poppyseed bagel. Comes with smoked meat, mustard and a pickle.

Each 'sandwich' comes with a choice of side salad or soup of the day.

Bagels were okay.  I found them a little too dense but you could tell they were made fresh.  Good bagels but feel like I've had better.

The sandwiches are good as well.  I did find the smoked salmon sandwiches overpowered by cream cheese. Didn't really taste the capers, onions or smoked salmon - maybe ask them to go light on the cream cheese.

The smoked sandwich I found really well balanced. Mustard cuts into the rich, smokiness of the meat which is great. Pickle was crisp and tasty. Poppyseed really worked well with the smoked meat.

Soup of the day was over cooked chicken and noodle. The 'noodles' in the soup were definitely breaking down and overly mushy but their flavor of the chicken broth was quite good.  Green salad was pretty typical - I should have tried their salad of the day instead.

341,P7WKwvdNNebY7yDOiCq9ig,1SWHrS6JVc5yLuJtBTds-g,16,5,6,"Went here for a UYE (unofficial Yelp event) one Friday evening at 7pm and when I pulled into the parking area, the parking area was packed so I parked close to the entrance of the parking area.

Going inside the restaurant, it was very busy and I was asked how many people. I mentioned that there was a reservation but forgot the name so I had to consult my cellphone. After consulting my cellphone, I mentioned ""Jason"" and she informed me that there wasn't a reservation for a ""Jason"" but after flipping through her book, she mentioned that there was a mix-up and they were in the other dining room area. The restaurant is divided into 2 dining areas.

I walked into the second dining area and tried to look for two of the people whom I would recognize (Kandi R. & Julia D.) and eventually saw Kandi waving at me. I sat down at the table and was introduced to D'Arcy L. and the organizer Jason M.

We were provided with the ""a la carte"" menus but decided to go for the AYCE so the server brought us the AYCE menu and we ordered items from it.

We then waited for the server to come back to us to pick up the paper where we indicated what we wanted which she left on our table. We waited and waited but the server didn't return. We then decided to bring our paper to one of the servers in the other dining room area. When we did this, our server returned and asked us how many people we are ordering for since 2 people had not arrived yet (Sarah M. and her +1)

For the soup, I opted to get hot & sour soup. I found it to be very good. Our party was evenly divided into hot & sour soup and wonton soup. It wasn't the best hot & sour soup that I've had but it was still very good. After we had our soups, Sarah and Lucas showed up. In terms of the items that we ordered which I really liked, I liked the deep fried shrimp wontons, peanut butter dumplings and the sesame beef. The orange beef was okay. I liked the General Tao chicken but most people in the table didn't seem to like it. The beef and broccoli was good as was the beef and fried noodles dish. I wasn't crazy about the pulled or shredded pork dish that we ordered nor did I really like the salted dry spare ribs.

To end off our dinner, I had a cup of coffee and green tea ice cream which were included. Kandi misunderstood and thought it was actual tea when she asked for it but didn't realize it was ice cream so I actually had 2 ice cream scoops as she didn't want the one which came for her.   :-)

Kandi ordered something take out and there was some confusion over her order where we had a good laugh about it.

We didn't manage to finish everything that we ordered but we didn't leave a lot on each plate and unlike in most AYCE restaurants, we weren't charged extra for this. It was also not mentioned on the menu that extra charges would apply for wasting food so it was good that we weren't charged extra. Another thing is that when ordering from the AYCE menu, things are not specified in terms of the number of pieces and they just give a plate of what is ordered based on the size of the table. In my opinion, this sort of encourages waste since when ordering for the second round, they basically gave us the same portions on the dish as what we ordered during the first round and some people in the table were already full or didn't want to have that item during the second round.

When paying, they brought their portable credit card machine which made it easier for us to pay. The place appears to have free WiFi. I didn't test it but saw an open/unencrypted hotspot with a name which I assume belonged to the restaurant. It is also a BYOB restaurant or bring your own wine restaurant. The cost for the AYCE dinner option on Friday was $28+tax+tip per person.

The service could be better in terms of coming to pick up our order papers. For water, they left us a pitcher which was good as we didn't have to hail the server for more water.

My family and I had a nice dinner at Mr. Spicy last week. All you can eat Chinese food isn't usually my thing, but Mr. Spicy is definitely a step up from Chinese Buffet. The upscale environment, attentive service and the ability to BYOB make Mr. Spicy a fantastic dining option. 

Food-wise, everything we ordered was good. Standout dishes include the hot & sour soup, chili eggplant and the General Tso's chicken. Like others have mentioned, the food is mostly sweet & sour. So if that's your thing, great. I can't really say this is the most authentic Chinese food, because it definitely caters to Western taste.

Mr. Spicy is a BYOB Chinese restaurant located in the West Island and neighbours the airport.  You need a car to get here but it is worth the drive.  

We ordered the all you can eat menu option which was about $28 and gave you the option of choosing whatever you wanted from their AYCE menu.  This particular menu offered lots of options so if you're hungry this is the way to go.  There is also an à la carte option if you are not in the mood to eat so much.

We ordered a ton of different dishes and some were excellent while others missed the mark.  My personal favourite was the sesame beef which was really crispy.  The beef and broccoli was another dish that I liked a lot.  The hot and sour soup on the other hand was a little underwhelming.  It wasn't very spicy.  I also found that the General Tao chicken could have been better.

Service here is spotty.  We had to hunt down our server every time we wanted to place an order and it took a while to get the food.  They also failed to bring a couple of the dishes that we ordered.  There is definitely room for improvement in this area.

Considering all the food we ate I feel that I definitely got my money's worth after eating here.

Look, I almost went into a long term depression when Hot & Spicy closed down on Decarie and almost died when the St-Martin location closed....but the head Chef moved on and opened up a smaller resto in the West Island! It's not the most ideal of places for us to get to (we're from Laval) but when it comes to quality grub, this is the place for me to get my Chinese fix.

We came here in a small group of friends and the first few things I noticed were :

- Smaller resto
- It's no longer an AYCE (at least as far as I saw on their menu)

That's fine by me, if they have quality food, I don't want this 2nd chance to be wasted with AYCE. Being a smaller place makes it more economical to run and I like the more intimate environment.

Let's cover the food shall we?

Hunan Dumplings 5/5
Absolutely delicious! The sauce/dumplings really are orgasmic. Why can't I find other types of dumplings that I like this much? The highlight of the evening for me. How I missed these!

Egg/Spring Rolls 5/5
Crunchy and tasty these rolls are to die for. The sauce is just right and this sets off the evening in thr right direction with this tasty treat.

Sesame Beef 5/5
Possibly the best Sesame Beef found anywhere in the GMA. They are somewhat crunchy with a tangy flavor, but when you bite into them the flavor just melts in your mouth. It's quite therapeutic.

Garlic Beef Noodles 5/5
A plate of dry noodles gets invaded by another plate of warm beef drenched in a succulent garlic sauce which makes the dry noodles lose their dryness and get infused by a sauce made by an incredible chef. Why am I drooling?

Orange Beef 4/5
I always enjoyed orange beef, the sauce us tangy and makes it a suitable change to your taste-buds with most plates being sweet.

General Tao 2/5
Usually a main event plate but for some reason the sauce tonight was off, far too tangy and it didn't taste right. I'll need to order this again on my next visit and see if this is a permanent change to their sauce or something that will never happen again. (Exception to the norm)

All in all, excellent food with minor touches to make to provide the optimal dining experience.

Service was quick and efficient and quite friendly. A nice change from the way the slower more stoic experience I had at Hot & Spicy in the past. 

Bill is acceptable, especially since if you go in a group you can order your favorite plates and split the cost.

However, even in the smoked meat capital of the world, there are different grades of smoked meat.  You cn settle for low budget diners and have-all restaurants that go cheap and offer Lesters which tastes, feels, and looks like it was injected with formaldehyde  or you can experience smoked meat the way it was supposed to be.

Montreal offers no shortage of classic smoked meat joints.  Delibees is one that really stands out.

Leave Schwartzs for the tourists.  If you want insanely good meat that doesnt require you to wait an hour in line around the block, then check out this hidden diamond in the rough in the Valois Village in Pointe Claire.  

This place has two locations connected  each other: a dingy dive bar (not the good kind) and the diner side.  Food is the same but youre better off entering the deli.

This meat is unbelievable: juicy, tender, and full of flavour.  Ive yet to have a bad experience at this place.  While another unnamed west island smoked meat hub has gotten progressively more expensive over the years with a slight downtrend in quality to accompany it, Delibees has managed to hold its own.

We ordered a grill cheese for the kids with a pasta salad for a side, and then my husband and I ordered a veggie panini and tried the won ton soup. The kids seemed to enjoy their grilled cheese (made with processed cheese - not what I'd anticipated), but my husband and I didn't think the soup was that good. There was also very little filling in our panini, but the food, albeit uninspired, was acceptable.

The kicker was that we had ordered two cartons of milk for our kids, one chocolate and one regular. The regular milk (with an expiry date two days in the future) had gone sour, and we unknowingly kept telling our toddler son to drink his milk even though he refused.

My impression upon entering the restaurant was that Montreal has finally found its place among some of the better-known steak establishments in the U.S. We were greeted by an attractive group of hostesses and were seated in a prompt and courteous manner. 

The food was presented very well by our waiter, and the quality of service went downhill from there. One of the members of my party was shown a rib steak in its raw form and instead received a much less impressive and fattier version. And as if that were not enough, halfway through our meal someone decided to reduce the lighting in the restaurant by about 50%, after which we had to almost beg for a candle for our table so that we could see what we were eating.

From a condescending response to how two members of our party requested their meat be cooked; to ignoring numerous requests for more butter; to having to hunt down a bus person to ask for fresh-ground pepper; to our request for plain water and serving us Evian instead, our waiter left the building. He definitely put a cloud over our experience. 

Service notwithstanding, the food was absolutely delicious. My NY strip was one of the best I ever had. My brother's lamb chops were enjoyable too. 

I would give 4 stars for food and 2 stars for service, therefore an overall rating of 3 stars is justified in my opinion.

The food is outstanding, with a large variety of fresh fish and other varieties of seafood and plenty of different cuts of meats.

Can't decide what to order? Split a few appetizers among friends; most are big enough to share.

With a full service bar and some great choices for dessert, 40 Westt is also a great little hangout for a cocktail and dessert around 10 or 11 o'clock.

L'accueil était bien, les hôtesses sont bien mises et classes. 

Samedi soir, la clientèle est jeune, hip, aisée ($). Le restaurant semble être fréquenté pas des habitués. Look simple et branché.

Nous avons chacun pris une entrée et tout le monde était satisfait. J'ai opté pour les pétoncles à l'érable, un pur délice, cuites à la perfection. Comme plat principal, rib steak. Beaucoup de gras mais je ne crois aps que ce soit la faute du restaurant mais plutôt la coupe de viande que j'ai choisi. La cuisson médium était, là encore, à la perfection. Les frites accompagnées d'une sauce aïoli, sublime. 

Le service, EXCELLENT. Enfin, je ne dirais pas le service mais plutôt, le serveur. Il se peut que d'autres aient une autre expérience au même restaurant tout simplement parce qu'ils sont tombés sur un mauvais serveur. Il était très présent sans être envahissant. Un service, honnête et sincère. Un serveur qui aime son travail et pas seulement le pourboire qui y est rattaché. Pourtant, il avait PLUSIEURS tables à sa charge. Une perle rare.

Nous avons tous choisi des coupes différentes, rib steak, filet mignon, cotelettes de veau. Tout le monde a adoré. 

Le dessert, soufflé au chocolat avec crême glace (dans le menu prix fixe pour 2), crême brûlée avec petits fruits, crême brûlée au cappuccino et croustade aux pommes. TOUS PARFAITS.

Came for a business dinner and we started with the raw seafood tower consisting of oysters, shrimp, lobster tails/claws and crab claws. It was all so incredibly fresh!

At a place like this, you NEED to order a steak. That's what they're known for! I ordered the 8 oz. filet mignon with melted brie and it was phenomenal - excellent cut, nice and tender, cooked perfectly, with the perfect compliment of the melted Brie on top. 

Whether you order the side of garlic mashed potatoes, French fries with the aioli sauce, or garlic spinach, neither will disappoint. Each side was amazingly delicious!

We have been to this establishment a few years ago and had a good experience, and so had decided to return for our fathers 75th birthday. 

Driving in from Toronto for a day trip, we wanted our only meal in Montreal to be a memorable one. 

We had foregone Queue de cheval and also Europea as options for the night, as we were also recently recommended 40 Westt by a colleague. 

Our night started off fine. Our waiter was very polite and lovely, but we found that he was slightly inexperienced with his knowledge of the meat cuts and the menu. Regardless, it was the quality of the food where things started to go downhill. 

We notified our waiter that we would be ordering a bunch of different items for sharing. The prime rib wasn't overly tender and at one point we were sitting with no sharing plates for 10 minutes watching the meat get cold. 
We also found some tissue paper in our Caesar  salad from god knows where as it was all cloth napkins on the table. The Caesar was replaced but we had finished most of it by then anyways so we didn't take it. 

The oyster Rockefeller was great (but small), as well as the Seabass. 

The meats however, continued to disappoint. The rib steak was tough and the filet mignon was overlooked and tough as well. The best word we found to describe the scampi, was 'mushy'. 

We brought this up to the manager at this point, who seemed rather defensive and asked 'if we have ever had scampi before? Because this is the way Icelandic Scampi is.' 
We have eaten lots of seafood, but the texture of this dish was that of mushiness that resembles unfresh raw material. We explained this to the manager who continued to go into examples with differences in lobster in America versus lobster in his home in Asia. His explanation felt quite derogatory and, as individuals who do spend a lot of time on cooking, quite unsatisfactory. 

Arguing with him at that point seemed to be pointless. We had just explained that we had looked forward to a good meal for our dad's big birthday and that this was very disappointing. We would have all been happier going to our other two choices. 

He offered to provide us with desserts on the house to make it up to us, and 'ordering or not would be our choice'. And promptly left after making that statement. We didn't see him again for the rest of the dinner. 
We did order some desserts at the end. 
Overall, the service was not up to par for an establishment of that quality and we will likely never go back or recommend anyone to go there. After reading some of the other reviews it seems that the food quality has been inconsistent.",40 Westt,2305 Autoroute Transcanada,Pointe-Claire,QC,Pointe-ClaireQC,H9R 5Z5,45.480670865,-73.7953591347,4.0,69,"Steakhouses, Nightlife, Seafood, Arts & Entertainment, Restaurants, Jazz & Blues"

There were other parties going on but they were all separated very well. The food and service were excellent as well as attention to detail. The only thing I didn't like was that we ordered 4 bottles of wine at $130 each and said we'll see how we do with those first. The server said don't worry he has this. Any way later on in the evening when we asked about the wine he said no problem and had been opening new bottles as they ran out. We had 10 bottles of red in total as well as multiple bottles of white which we would probably not have ordered as much if we were asked first. I've always been used to the server asking before opening a new bottle. So please beware and make sure the server understand exactly what you want.

Ocean small sampler: The tray comes with  an array of sauces for the seafood. The oysters were extremely fresh,  the shrimps were huge and meaty. However the lobster claws were on the smaller side.  Overall, the freshness were on point.

Iceberg salad: Being a fan of blue cheese, I still felt the sauce was a bit too rich.  Needs more cherry tomatoes to balance the richness of the dressing.

Steaks: The porterhouse had a nice char and was well seasoned.  The middle part is tender and almost just melts in your mouth. Wow... just wow. The prime ribs...How can I say this? It's freaking awesome. It's the best I've had. You can't compare the quality anywhere else in Montreal.

The main course was next, in which we both enjoyed a nice big filet mignon.  The sides were to share for the table, and we sampled the mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach.  The french fries were outstanding, though, but I think that's just cuz fries are good EVERYWHERE in Montreal.

I was not willing to argue as our friends were present and didn't want to embarrass them with my No filter attitude I just got up and let them re-assign our seats .. pretty bummed as we were seated right next to the door and air vents and it was pretty inconvenient lots of traffic and it was pretty cold where we got re-assigned. 

The waiters were pretty snobbish and acted like they were entitled 
So far not going so well. I asked them why we didn't have any cutlery or napkins on our new table and they responded ""you didn't order yet"" hmmm the other table we were seated was equipped with all of that.

Food: it was pretty delicious and thankfully it made up for the very rude service. We had the tomahawk Steak caramelized onions for 2 asked for medium rare came out amazingly.

I also Decided to order the sea bass with wild rice waw it was delicious ... so delicious

We opted for the bar side with live entertainment.

We shared the Tomahawk steak for two.
Cooked Pittsburg style. Charred on outside and rare on inside . Cooked perfectly. They did not cheat and have the right grill to get charred done.
Some places cheat and use butter but not here.

Side we had fries, asparagus which were done right

Once seated the menu is great there's so much to choose from it's hard to pick just one you have plenty of meat and seafood that you will not be going home disappointed. Personally I went with the 6oz fillet mignon and Caribbean lobster tail with the sautés spinach as my side. The meat was cooked perfectly and melted in the mouth and the lobster was juicy and buttery. The waiters were excellent and made sure that the experience was the absolute best water was always refilled without having to ask bread and butter were always provided and they were friendly about any question or modification.

We were a group of over 20 people to celebrate a friend's birthday. Despite the fact that we were many the food was cooked to perfection and the service was amazing. We had no choice but select from the group menu. I liked that on the cover of the printed group menu were the words ""Happy Birthday Medy & Hani"". I had never seen a restaurant do that before .

I had the salmon tartare with smoked chipotle, avocado and cucumber. It was fresh and light. My boyfriend had the grilled calamari with onions and capers which he really enjoyed. I rather eat grilled octopus or fried calamari than grilled calamari so I didn't share his enthusiasm.

My boyfriend had gotten up to make me a drink since we had bottle service and the gin, vodka and chasers were located behind the table. Meanwhile a waiter came and thought he was done with his grilled calamari plate and took it away. He had maybe 1/4 left on his plate. Our waitress saw that I had a look on my face so she came over to me and I explained to her that he was not finished and that the waiter had taken his plate so she apologized on his behalf and made my boyfriend a new calamari plate which had even more calamari on it! Talk about top notch service! We both told her she didn't need to do that but she insisted.

As a main, I had the pistachio crusted rack of lamb with potatoes, caramelized onions, carrots and other season vegetables. I love lamb and I was not disappointed. 

My boyfriend had the 8 oz striploin ""carpet bag"" with garlic mashed potatoes, mushroom in a wine reduction. It was delicious! Lucky for me he was so full from the calamari that I was able to finish his plate. If I had to pick one of the 2 mains,  I would pick the striploin.

For dessert we had the chocolate soufflé with vanilla ice cream. I took a bite because I was full and I don't normally eat dessert but it was good.

I would definitely come back and I highly recommend!",40 Westt,2305 Autoroute Transcanada,Pointe-Claire,QC,Pointe-ClaireQC,H9R 5Z5,45.480670865,-73.7953591347,4.0,69,"Steakhouses, Nightlife, Seafood, Arts & Entertainment, Restaurants, Jazz & Blues"

It's absolutely enormous and you keep walking and walking to your seat.... high ceilings. Pure class. Ambiance is dope.

The menu has a lot of options, so... if you're a meat lover (and thus understandably a normal functional person) you'll be treated to the nines. The menu is $$$$+. A cut of steak is easily $60 and comes with no thrills. My NY strip steak, some fries, an amaretto sour and a lava cake was $100.... and easily worth it!

The NY steak was prepped to perfection. Thick juice cut. Medium rare and was an experience to be cherished at every bite. The fries and aioli sauce was a great side. While I waited for the meat to be prepped I was presented with a great amaretto sour. There was a mishap at first as I was served with an old fashioned but when the waitress noticed my face she quickly inquired and corrected the issue. I was allowed to keep the old fashioned, complementary of course. Did I mention our waitress Penelope was great? Staff are great here. Helpful and attentive.

I'm quite fond of Lava Cake and it was d-lish. Came with some vanilla ice cream and I went to school with my creative hot and cold sampling.

The cowboy cut is a significant piece of meat to screw up for the lunch rush.  It's too bad because it was well seared and the flavour was quite good.  I did make a point to express my dissatisfaction and a replacement piece of meat was offered which was an expected gesture.  Was it as good as the original?  No.  But at least it was cooked as requested.  

We ordered a dozen oysters.  Malpeques aren't a premium oyster but cost $51 for a dozen.  That's just really overpriced.  They weren't even well-shucked.  Some had pieces of broken shell in them.  They were also completely inconsistent in size.  

As for the other items we tried: spinach was pretty average and the fries were probably the worst I've had in awhile.  We requested a pasta for a child and it was fine.  Nothing fancy.  Surprisingly, an order of crab was the best part even though some pieces were definitely better tasting than the others.  

I know for a fact there was an event happening in the back section of the restaurant.  Could this have been a reason why the food wasn't up to snuff?  Possibly.  

It seemed like this place is doing well with the business lunch crowd.  Expense accounts must be the norm.  Given the four star rating on Yelp, I was actually quite excited to try this place but I wasn't impressed at all.

My lobster came out with amazing presentation and was cracked in such a way as to make it very easy to rip out the huge pieces of lobster meat, however, I could barely finish it because it had been overcooked and was chewie. Not wanting to send it back I just ate it.

Being a student, bulk shopping is almost a must and Costco has nearly EVERYTHING you can ask for from 1kg family sized chip bags to clothes, new books, electronics and fruits and veggies. This place is amazing! I've already decided that if a zombie apocalypse were to erupt, I'm taking refuge inside of a Costco and kicking everyone out. I'd surely live comfortably for months.

Heck, they even sell beds, have their own bakery and kitchen as well as an incredibly cheap and tasty fast food shop in the front. The 65$/year (it was 65$ last I heard for Gold membership) is WELL worth the price. You'll save so much money!

Yes, the inside looks ugly, yes there aren't that many staff members and that's why Costco is so cheap (apart from selling their merchandise in bulk). Costco realized that a smart customer will not actually care if the floor is of its store is made out of neatly packed tiles or concrete. Costco is there to sell merchandise, not look pretty and it does it VERY VERY well.

CEO also pays his employees handsomely on top of it and treats them well.

Hey why write a Costco review, we all know what's Costco! It's the good old Club Price! YEah That place is the joke The Simpsons mock once where Barney was drunk as hell and talking to a giant bottle of honey  in the shape of a woman that falls and then he think he killed her! Yeah that Costco! Supersize item of the most common thing you need in life. Everybody I know that goes to Costco has the same issue: they can't go there and spend less than a 100$! That's the ultimate choice of being a Costco member, accepting the fact you'll be over-excited by those 1 kg (2.2lbs) of Kettle chips!  Those 72 rolls of toilet paper and those  huge 4 kg jar of Hellmans' Mayo. Can we still call it a jar at 4 kg? Regardless the only thing I think his really worth sharing about Costco are the cool things that we don't know. 

1) Batteries. Damn batteries, I HATE buying 4 pack of AA Duracells, makes me feel like I'm going to need more and then i'll use the one in my remote control, thinking 4 was not enough after all!

2) Cell phone bundle! Yeah !! I'm not kidding, it even beat the corporate bundle I have at my job . alsmost 3 years ago I was looking for a Blackberry Bold 9000 and there was nothing under 199$ with a 3 yr contract. Costco had an additional 50$ off and cool and easy to pick bundle. So check out for their deal, they're quite impressive and they offer service for Fido, Rogers Telus, Bell, I'm not sure but i think Virgin too! 

3) Cheapest AAA Filet Mignon! 18.99$/KG (divde by 2.2 for price per pound)  for canadian AAA filet mignon beef. Now there's a lot of quality within the AAA meat and this is the lowest AAA but it's like, who's gonna bitch about eating the cheapest best categorie meat! Not ME!

4) Cheese! I'm a cheese fan. Now there's large variety of OK cheese and classic that is a must in your kitchen to have at all time. JArlberg for hamburgers or Sandwich, I like it! Parmesan Reggiano (Sorry for the spelling) and boccoccini (another spelling disaster). Gruyere. Point made.

5) SOMETIME the homemark (Kirkland) is awesome and the price is AMAZING. I bought a 13 pieces set Kirkland Inox kitchen battery. The same quality would normally be like 400-500$ and I paid 196$ + tax! 

Pourquoi écrire une critique sur Costco? On sait tous qu'est-ce que c'est Costco, Dans les année 90's c'était Club Price.  Très big, puissant acheteur et probablement le magasin qui a le plus de membre au monde. Les Simpson avaient même faites une blague ou on voyait Barney Gumble courtiser une bouteille Géante de Miel en forme de Femme qu'il accroche, fait tombé et coule alors une quantité astronomique de miel. Oui oui! Costco c'est ça, c'est un magasin ou tout ou presque est en Format dit économique. Tout le monde qui rentre au Costco ont souvent la même volonté; ne pas dépenser plus de 100$. Et chaque fois la volonté est crocheté par ce super-démon consommateur en soit qui veut pas arrêter de mettre des bidules dans le panier - gigantesque - d'épicerie. On devient tous sur-excité par nos pêchés mignon qu'on découvre en format impossible, des bonnes croustilles Kettle d'un kilo. Les 72 rouleaux DOUBLE de papier de toilette. Des contenants de 4 kg de mayo. Oui plusieurs resto se fournisse ici et il y a donc une logique a tout ça mais reste quand même qu'on y retrouve des produits exclusifs et de la variété incroyable. Voici ce que pas nécessairement tout le monde savent du Costco:

1) Des piles, des savons des bas, ces cocheneries que nous achetons souvent en petits paquet et qui coûtent si cher. P-e suis-je une personne unique mais j'HAIS ça acheter ces trucs. C'est tellement des trucs hors-budget qu'on ne prévoyait pas s'acheter qui sont inintéressants dans un panier d'épicerie.

2) Les contrats de cellulaire. Il y a un stand dans chaque Costco et ils ont vraiment de très bon forfait téléphonique. Exemple personnel: Il y a 2-3 ans j'ai acheté un Blackberry BOLD 9000 la-bas et c'était a l'époque 199$ + contrat de 36 mois. Au Costco c'était 149$ + contrat de 36mois. Belle économie dans un monde où au Canada, on sent toujours qu'on se fait arnaquer de façon monumental.

3) La Viande!!! Yeah! ils ont du Filet mignon AAA Canadien a 18.99$ le kg quand on achète le filet entier. Géniale comme économie ou dans les épiceries on paye pour deux A-AA a 25.99$. Est-ce que c'est le meilleur AAA nah! c'est le plus cheap des AAA. Entre-vous et moi, C'est le moins bon haute-de-gamme du filet mignon, big deal!

4)LE FROMAGE! Ils ont tellement un belle variété qu'on peut acheté et dans ses essentiels je penses au Jarlberg qui est extra dans les hamburger ou les sandwich. Le Regiano, les bocconcinis, du Gruyère, du cheddar en grain frais du jour!

5)DESFOIS, je dis bien desfois, la marque maison (Kirkland) est juste vraiment bonne! Exemple, je suis acheté un ensemble de 13 morceaux en acier inoxydable d'une batterie de cusine Kirkland. Même qualité d'une compagnie plus connue j'aurais payé 300-500 juste 196+taxe!",Costco Wholesale,5701 Autoroute Transcanadienne,Pointe-Claire,QC,Pointe-ClaireQC,H9R 1B7,45.4693946,-73.8178931,4.5,13,"Grocery, Shopping, Wholesale Stores, Tires, Food, Automotive"

It's a main entrance at a corner and to the right while to the left is a line of people with their carts showing their receipts to associates on their way back to the parking lot.  Ho hum carbon copy?  Sort of, kind of maybe... 

This Costco has a good extra 5 feet from the check out first displays so there's more room for the lines... what a great idea right?  

For me the thing that totally differentiates this Costco is yes, they have wine and beer.  Pittsburgh, nope.  Ontario, no way.  While in Ontario we can now purchase beer at certain grocery stores, this has always been a thing in Quebec for as long as I can remember.  Being able to buy a single beer at Couche-Tard was sort of a privilege and a convenience at the same time.

I'm normally not a breakfast fan, but I only had 30 min break and needed something fast and close by. I was very nervous at the time over something else and was watching every minute, so I asked the waiter to just bring me the fastest thing on their menu and to wrap it up into a sandwich so I could carry it in my hand as I ate and walked back to work. He said it was no problem and seemed very like... willing to help and accomodate me, he was awesome. He suggested that I'd get the scrambled eggs and bacon and that he'd wrap it up into a sandwich for me to take fast. And served me free coffee which was good enough to drink black.

He brought me the styrofoam take out container maybe 5-7 min later, no sandwich which was why I'm punishing this review by one star lol, but everything tasted... surpriingly great lol

The bacon tasted like real bacon. I'm not a crispy fan, I usually like mine very soft. He said the bacon would be fast because they always have some on stand by since they're constantly cooking so many orders of it, so I knew it wasn't fresh for my personal order, but it tasted surprizingly great. I'm surprized I like crispy bacon for a change lol It still tasted fresh, like it was made not long ago. Wasn't over done, it was just so good and a nice portion of it too.

The scrambled eggs had a really nice fluffy texture to them and flavored really well. Toast was good. Made my own sandwich lol was great.

What I was really taken by was the side order of fresh fruit that actually tasted FRESH! Normally, I stay away from all ""fresh"" fruit in restaurants because it's usually soggy and crap (even from the Sheraton Hotel room service), but here it was fkn great. The watermelon was sooo yummy. Cantaloup was delicious, and the strawberrie's green leaves were not even dry. I don't know if I just caught them on a day where their fruit inventory just arrived... but I lucked out! Great deal for just 11$.

Compared to other Japanese restaurants in Montreal (or Canada for that matter), Katoreya prepares a slightly more traditional variation of Sushi (which is a good thing for traditionalist like me). Still they come up with some innovative variations on the Japanese tradition. 

For example, their salmon/shrimp roll, called ""Indochine"", is like a spring roll wrapped in a rice leaf; tasty and original. They managed the challenge of preparing excellent Ama Ebi, Ika and Tako. These three ingredients were very fresh, delicious and usually reveal whether the chef knows his trade or not. 

The service was kind and attentive but not intrusive. When asked a question about a special dish the waiter did not know the answer but politely referred to the chef for clarification. Well done. One doesn't need to know everything but instead needs to be classy enough to find out from someone who does.

A salad without any dressing. Just a bunch of mint leaves and a cm sized shrimp. 
The waiters, although polite, kept hovering around us and made us uncomfortable. Oh and they also charge for ginger and wasabi (it doesn't even come with the specialty rolls order)  they also brought out our sushi two orders at a time instead of all at once which I didn't like. 
Also, each roll was the size of my hand. Please make your rolls smaller and bite size! Don't make it impossible/embarrassing for us to try to chew/choke on it.

Waitress came, looks friendly at first but we needed sometime to decide for our order. When we were ready about 4 minutes after, we called the waitress (Asian), we gave her our orders from lunch menu and we were told that they don't serve lunch during weekends. WHATTT??? Why nobody told us? It is not written anywhere and they obviously gave us a menu with Breakfast and Lunch on it! Now, the waitress was a bit irritated, trying to hide it, but it was still obvious, who's fault huh?! So frustrating! 

Finally, not so long, we called her again and order from their breakfast menu... ordered 1 chocolate pancake for my kids (sharing 3 & 6 yo - not big eaters), cheeseburger deluxe for my husband, and a plate of 2 poach eggs with asparagus, ham and cheese, with potatoes and fruits for me to share with my mom (senior and not a big eater). 
We are use to order like this, not because we don't want to spend more. There were several times that we ordered for each person and ended up wasting the leftovers and that is what we are avoiding. After she took our orders, she told us that there will be a charge of $3.75 (or $3.95) for sharing (OH WELL, THANK YOU FOR TELLING US THIS TIME!). 

We strongly disagreed and we asked why there is a charge? She doesn't have any explanation and uttered several times that she could call her boss and we could discuss with her. This waitress doesn't really have patient to talk to us, so fine... She called another staff wherein she clearly told us that we could talk to her boss (huh, so what happened at the back?). So the other older staff cannot explain anything as well and just said ""because the owner said it""! We were trying to deliver our argument that we disagree for the fee for sharing because they will not add anything on my plate anyway. I am ordering a full meal for me, i wont finish it, so either I take the left over home or share with my mom. We just dont get it!!! 

Behind us are other staff that while we were discussing, their heads are shaking from side to side. So we felt very uncomfortable overall and decided to leave.

If you are thinking of coming here, think again!
I hope you are not sharing food!
I hope you dont get the Filipina or Asian girl! Fyi, I am Filipina too, but I have a decency to execute my job properly regardless of their race and status. 
I hope you dont have kids! Oh yes, while we are ordering, I was told by this waitress to tell my 3 yo daughter to take her feet off the chair (she was goofing around - typical 3yo - sitting up and down, while mommy is ordering) but yes of course, I asked my daughter to take off her feet and seat properly which I am actually about to do if she just let me finish telling her my orders first. 
At some point, I agree that my daughter should have behaved more and stay seated, but I was never told the same even in fine dining restaurants. Oh well!

I would be tempted to give a full 5 stars, but I hafta remove a star for a coupla unfortunate isssues. Though I still definitely recommend going out of your way to check this out. 

Came for brunch with a gf of mine (Chris), we wanted a place more near her place but still a decent brunch option. We had Bistro Nolah in our minds, but they were unfortunately just opening back up after summer vacation only for supper service the day we wanted. So a quick Yelp search through my bookmark collection for Brunch led us here and thanks to the recommendations of my fellow Yelpers: we were not disappointed in having to second choice this spot. 

We both chose Benedictins (not likely to make it ourselves at home), expensive at 15-18$ per plate but soooooooo worth it. 

She took the Canadian if memory serves, and I chose the Californian : bacon AND avocado AND cheese?? Yes. Fkin. Please. Unfortunately Hollandaise sauce was slightly too watery, not quite as creamy as I like; and bright yellow, like NEON ...what is up w that? It tasted alright though, so fine. Then the avocado was wayyy too underripe, soooo sad :( :( . This is where I must remove stars, don't offer me avocado if it's hard and tasteless: I don't want it and I certainly don't want to pay more for it. Then the bacon was slightly too crispy too, but now I'm being picky. 

Incredible portions though. And that fruit bowl that accompanies each and every single plate?! Omg sooooooo worth it! Best fruit bowl ever! It's not an after thought here, they take pride in the fruit offering and it so shows! The potatoes that accompany the plates are deeeeelicious too! Crispy outside fluffy inside, no salt or sauce needed, but indulge if you so prefer. 

The coffee was decent, not great, not terrible and refilled fairly frequently so that's a plus! 

The decor was calm and soothing and still very kool. My friend found it amusing there was a Stonewall photograph, she explained the story behind it (Stonewall riots https://g.co/kgs/jrfgBN ) and was happy to see it as a sign of acceptance to all. Among other beautiful worldly photographs of various sizes, all black and whites, which adorn the walls. 

We had a lovely time, service lagged a bit at the end and we had to pack our own to-go containers (note to future self: really start remembering to bring tupperware), but our waitress was super sweet, friendly and just lovely, so I really can't complain.

I went to this place after seeing the sign through the kanda sushi window while having dinner at Kanda.

Place is new, medium size ....great decor and modern, may be its brand new...also caters for all group size..2-6. Also saw a section on the side for large group.

Went with my gf for dinner on a friday eve. This is an all you can eat place

The lady at the door have an attitude and not so friendly, seems like all the female staff have some sort of an attitude issue... on the other hand all the male staff are very friendly and helpful.

Each table will get a galaxy tablet to order. Unfortunately the lady waitress didn't bother explaining anything and she just left the tab at the table and walked away...so we assumed all and ordered...the male staff were happy to answer our questions..While ordering u can see the picture of the sushi and its content.. once u submit ur order one waiter will bring a print out of ur order to ur table.

So when waiter brings your food, they cross the print out to make sure u received ur order. That also helps me, majority of the time all these all u can eat places we were not sure if we got all the food and also if we got the right food. This also helped me here, the waitress showed up at my table with sushi even though i got mine and it was crossed, she showed up crossed on top of it....and i have to tell her hey listen i already got this and its crossed. seems like she wanna push her leftovers on to us...

Also noticed that they put reserve signs for all the booth to pack the first comers and save the booth for late comers. Even though we showed up at 830pm. And we stayed until 9:45-10:0 and majority of the booths were not taken.

Quality of sushi is good compared to other ""all you can eat"" places in west island. Enough variety compared to other places, Its taste fresh.

A good place to enjoy sushi and will definitely go back, (will ignore the female staff ) just because the quality of the food.  Price to quality and value its good.

Will definitely go back and recommend to all sushi lovers

527,nifOPHlUiMAtYxh7-qGpzQ,lx4vVJndLJjRmZKQNIaXpA,1,0,0,"The only reason you go to an all you can eat sushi restaurant is to order as much of everything as possible. Bearing that in mind, it is impossible to expect any real quality sushi (or anything). 

The fish used might be fresh, but their sushi are bland and stale. The sautéed meet dishes were fine but only because they were saucy and salty (much like general tso chicken at an AYCE Chinese). The same goes for the majority of their menu items. 

I rarely criticize service as there is usually a minimum to ensure a healthy restaurant experience. The service here is well below the minimum! On all three occasions (which, for the record, I was brought back against my will), service was horrible. I can forgive a server for mixing up orders and making mistakes as we are only human, but no paying customer should ever have to experience the sort of attitude received here. 

Tipping. It is usually a straight forward process: 15% if satisfied; more if amazing; less if dissatisfied, and servers leave you to your decision. Not here. God help you if you tip a penny less than 15%. I have seen servers argue for their dues, even attempt to overcharge/ keep the change for tip. For some reason I remember them including a service tax for some time and still requiring you to pay a 15% tip.

In sum, if you have to eat here you should do so during the lunch time special. The $30+ for dinner (after 14h00) is just too expensive for what you get.

Let me start with the food before I explain the service. The fish is fresh, and doesn't have that weird waxy texture you experience sometimes. The temperature is also good, not cold. The selection is also excellent, far better that Kanda across the street. This aspect is actually pretty close to perfect for an all you can eat. Unfortunately, we don go to a restaurant only for the food, but the service as well. That's were the story is:

We were a group of 4, for supper on a Thursday night. It was quite busy, all the tables were full.

We started off the evening with a very quick request for our order, even before we had a chance to see the menu at length and before our whole party had arrived. Normally, this takes the longest, so we were happy that it looked like the service would be nice and prompt.

My friend and I ordered the sushi pizza and some teriyaki chicken while we waited for the other 2 people to show up. It took almost 15 minutes for that order to arrive, by which point we had prepared our second order after the party was complete.

That order took close to 20 minutes to arrive, and we placed our third order. This is where everything went downhill.

We waited and waited, and were delivered sushi pizza again, despite not remembering ordering it. Alright, we were hungry, having waited over 10 minutes at that point at an empty table. Then we saw what looked like our order delivered to a table next to us. The people at that table seemed confused, but they didn't really argue and took a large plate with over 40 pieces on it. Then, we got another sushi pizza. This was a bit of a surprise, but hey, we were hungry... We asked the waited to look into our order, and he couldn't find it anymore. So we made another one.

Then I witnessed something that had our table in tears we were laughing so hard, because a table behind us received an order of sushi pizza, and they had the most perplexed look on their face as the waiter served it to them. They had clearly not ordered it. But they took the plate anyways.

Finally, 35 minutes after we had finished the second order, and two sushi pizzas we didn't order arrived, we got half of the third order. At this point we were fed up, but still hungry, so we placed a 4th and final order.

The second half of the third order never showed up, but we got half of the 4th order.

All in all, we spent 2 hours and 15 minutes at the restaurant, and had food on our table for about 30 minutes of that.

PROs
- Ordering off a tablet (you can see each item, no waiting to order, best thing ever)
- Service is FAST (instead of bringing everything at once, waiters will keep coming back with plates and check them off a list)
- Staff is friendly (IMO a rarity when service is unconventional)
- Sushi is tasty (all of this would count for nothing if the product wasn't good)
- Large variety (I don't know how they manage from a operations standpoint)

CONs
- Pricey (Despite a totally justified price, there are cheaper places to get a sushi dinner)

FOOD: The sushis are ok, they aren't the best and don't taste the freshest. Also, they put way too much rice in their sushi (which I'm sure is to fill you up as fast as possible). However, their hot foods are pretty good! And I like the fact that they offer takoyakis (fried octopus balls) at dinner. Overall, food is decent, not the best place to go though.

My co-worker and I went on a Thursday during lunch and the service is super speedy unlike Kanda which is directly across the street. We were sat down immediately and handed an ipad without any explanation as to what to do. Good thing we are smart enough to figure it out, click the picture of what you want. When you are finished hit SEND. I was a bit upset to discover that some sushi rolls weren't available; especially something as common as Spicy Salmon. I could eat pounds and pounds of that but didn't have not even one piece here. 

The food arrived at lightening fast speed. That was great. I noticed that their kitchen foods were much better than their sushi. The sushi actually left a lot to be desired. A lot of the sushi was covered in sauces. I wasn't a fan of that as I'm picky and hate sauce. (I eat my dumplings and spring rolls with soy sauce and wasabi). 

There was no low-sodium soy sauce which was also a bit upsetting and lead to large amounts of water being consumed which meant that when we left I felt like I needed to be rolled out of there instead of walking. The wasbai was HOT and I loved that. I feel like a lot of places make their wasabi far too tame,. I should have tried the wasbai prior to adding it to my soy sauce because I used too much! 

Also, when it came time to pay the bill my co-worker paid and left a small tip. He told the server to keep all the change and then he was going to leave some more change on the table for him. The waiter actually looked at him and was like, ""That's it?"" Dude are you kidding me? Our server changed 10 times through the lunch hour and we had the intention of leaving more money on the table. He wasn't going to break a 10 when he had some loonies and toonies in his pocket! I found that very rude.

I had never had the opportunity in the past because my bf is allergic to all fish and seafood, so I never had someone to share it with. A few girlfriends decided our next girls' night would include a sushi stop in order to pop my proverbial cherry.

We tried to make a reservation on a Saturday night at 7:30, but word to the wise, no reservations are taken between 6 & 8pm on Saturdays. And also, for those who stated there was no alcohol, they have indeed procured their liquor licence, so the next time you're here, you can wash down your sushi with a cold pint of Sapporo. Also, a few people mentioned the water was undrinkable; this is no longer the case. The water was perfectly fine.

Back to the important stuff! We arrived at about 7:30 to a line almost out the door. We saw a lot of tables looking ready to leave, so we decided to stick around because everything looked SO DELICIOUS!! We waited about 30 minutes, which really isn't that bad, and were seated. The decor is modern and classy, staff is polite and attentive. Once we were seated, our table was handed a tablet and explained how to order. I am in love with this concept! The entire menu is loaded onto it, with descriptions of each item and the option to add whatever number you desire. Once your order is complete, you send it to the kitchen. A disclaimer is displayed explaining that for every uneaten piece, you will be charged 1$, so all bases are covered. Once your order is sent, a printed up ""receipt"" is given to your table and every time a dish is brought out, it gets crossed off. This is an awesome way to reduce human error. And the service was quite quick and friendly.

Now, on to the pièce de resistance! OH. EM. GEEE!! I was floored at how much I actually enjoyed the sushi and sashimi. We had salmon sashimi, spicy dragon eye, kamikaze, california, tempura, cucumber... It's all a magnificent and delicious blur! My favourite would have to be the spicy dragon eye.

We originally wanted to go to the sushi place across the street (I believe that the name was Kanda) but we discovered as we drove by Blvd St-Jean that it was closed down. The parking lot in front of Sushi St-Jean gets full very quickly. At the time that we arrived, we were seated almost immediately.

This was my first time eating here but I've been to various AYCE (all you can eat) sushi places and I found this place to be good. I did not have any issues with the service or food. Unlike the other places that I've been to which require you to indicate on a piece of paper the quantity of the item(s) that you want, this place has you do it on a tablet which has pictures for every item. On the tablet, you select whether you want the screens to be in English or French and then indicate the quantity of the item that you want shown in the picture. There is then an option on the screen to send your order to the kitchen. The wait staff will then bring your order to your table when the item is ready. When my friend and I ordered from the tablet, there were a few times that the tablet's screen appeared to be frozen but one of the wait staff assisted us with this when he noticed that we were having an issue.

I had a variety of maki rolls, sushi, tempura dishes, and Asian dishes from their menu: http://www.sushistjean.ca/main/en.html

My friend and I finished off with ice cream for dessert. They had 3 flavours (mango, green tea, and red bean). I had 1 scoop of each. My friend didn't really care for the mango but I liked all 3 flavours. When we left at ~1:30pm, there was a line to be seated.

My only negative comment about this place is that unlike other AYCE sushi places that I've tried for lunch (such as Kanda, Fisshu, and Sushi Plus), Sushi St-Jean doesn't offer sashimi. It only offers sashimi during dinner. So if you want the raw salmon, you have to get it with the rice on the bottom. One of the plates had small bits/pieces of sashimi on what appeared to be on a Pringle chip. I never had this at any other sushi restaurant before so I found this unusual.

Sushi St-Jean doesn't accept Interac or American Express. They do accept Mastercard and Visa. They have a sign at the entrance of the door indicating this.

I rate Sushi St-Jean 4 stars but I am not sure if I would go back there since they don't have sashimi during lunch and it is a bit out of the way for me to go there (even though I have a car and there are various buses that stop relatively close-by at the Fairview Shopping Center).",Sushi St-Jean,1000 Boulevard Saint-jean,Pointe-Claire,QC,Pointe-ClaireQC,H9R 5P1,45.4698222137,-73.8321464616,2.5,60,"Japanese, Restaurants, Sushi Bars"

As Mark G. reviewed, do not drink the water. They only offer Perrier as a substitute, they do not have bottled or filtered water. 

They have yet to obtain their liquor license, so you're limited to soft drinks or juice. 

The service was good, however our first server struggled in communicating with us, whereas the second server was completely fluent. 

As per Mark G's comments in regards to the ordering, I would have to once again agree. It does leave room for error. We ordered shrimp skewers, which aren't for the faint of heart. The entire shrimp is left on, and you must peel away the shell, head and tail. 

I had to specifically ask for vegetarian sushi, due to it not being listed on the menu. Once it arrived, we were a little overwhelmed by there being 12 pieces of sushi, and not the usual 2 or 4. Their definition of a vegetarian roll is different, and quite good; avocado, tofu, cucumber, mango and egg. A touch on the sweet side and very refreshing!

We received around one plate of 5 sushi every 10 minutes, we were 5 so that's 1 sushi to eat per hour. There strategy is to have the slowest service possible so that you don't eat much.

So I used to be a pretty regular customer here. I loved this place. Obviously it's not the best sushi in the West Island, but clearly not a bad deal for AYCE. I am not a very picky eater. I always tip the wait staff very well wherever I go and I consider myself a pretty decent customer who rarely ever complains. I have never, in my entire life, written a bad review for a restaurant before. In this sort of situation, I felt like it was needed and necessary for all you foodies out there. 

Now, I can handle a few service blunders (such as mild rudeness and forgotten orders-this is an AYCE after all), however.....SPIDER IN MY ICE CREAM!!!!!!

What can be worse than finding a SPIDER IN MY ICE CREAM you ask? Not much you would think, right? WRONG!!!!!

The way they handled the situation afterwards was deplorable. I mentioned to the waiter that there was a SPIDER IN MY ICE CREAM, and he hastily removed it from my line of sight (not quickly enough for me not to snap a picture) and, instead of apologizing, asked me if I wanted another one....Um.....NO THANK YOU...I then went on to mention that although I did not want to be mean, this sort of thing is generally unacceptable. He then proceeded to tell me that it could not be their fault, because that (spider) ice cream came from a ""brand new tub"". 

other waiter then came with our bills, and when we mentioned the issue for a second time (hoping for at least an apology), he gave me the dirtiest look and basically walked away. No discount, nothing.

I am never coming here again, and for your own sake, you should not either. Who knows what else might be hidden in their food.

Better than the all you can eat places but not quite at level of a Maiko, Park Place or the old Koji Kaizen in terms of food quality, creativity, service and ambience. Note to Avocado sushi chefs: sushi rice should not be cold or hard! I wonder if some of the more common pieces were made in advance. The place is very small and cramped. The wait staff is friendly but it's clear they are not experienced pros. Maybe I expect too much from the wait staff. When you don't order wine, please remove the 4 wine glasses from an already cramped table. Also, keep an eye on the table so you can remove serving dishes as they are used. I had to ask them multiple times. What's with the plastified menus and magic markers? Paper too expensive?

I started with a cucumber martini which was strong but I didn't quite like it though so I switched to white wine afterwards.

We shared the Japanese salad which is just a regular lettuce salad with dressing that tastes like sesame. It reminds me of the Kraft Asian Sesame dressing that I bought at Metro. I think perhaps I should have tried the seafood one instead. I tried the Japanese salad because tons of people here on yelp were recommending it. 

Next we had the avocado tartare which is made with spicy scallop and salmon, wasabi lobster, tempura and sweet sauce. It was good and reminded me of the xmas tree sushi that they have at Saint sushi but in a martini glass. I prefer the xmas tree though. Also I didn't feel like it was sweet at all which is a good thing. This was my boyfriend's favorite of the night. 

My boyfriend  thought the makis were nothing special but I enjoyed both. We ordered the 
Barenaked sushi roll (spicy lobster and scallops rollup in salmon sashimi and rice paper) and the Maki St Laurent (spicy salmon, rice, blueberry, teriyaki sauce rolled in rice paper). 

One downer was that I had asked for spicy mayo when we got our sushi but I got tired of waiting and just ate. The time we finally got it we were done our sushi.

The food is tasty, much better than all those all-you-can-eat. Definitely a place to go if you're a small party of 2-4. The setting is very simple and charming, and the service is on point.

Definitely recommend the Avocado tartare (not actually avocado, see picture). There is a variety of tartares in there, with a hint of crunches (rice crispies?), but it's definitely filling and very well worth the 17$

The Asian twist is full of flavor, but a little confusing as it emcompasses salty and sweet at the same time, in the same bite. Texture is complex as it is crunchy yet soft in some other areas. The maple syrup adds a little sweetness after taste. All in all, that dish in particular is a mouthful, but i wouldn't discourage from trying.

We also had the Sashimi straight up. Very well made, although not totally impressed with the octopus. Maquerel isn't my favourite, it's a very salty fish, but the butterfish was delicious!

As far as the food and service goes everything was great.  I didn't really do much ordering of the food as I was with friends that did that but for the few items I did select everything was as good or better than expected.

The decor is a little old-school for my taste - lots of brown and well, brown. They have a full bar and the dining area is a decent size. They have a wide selection of dishes to choose from, and also offer a lunch buffet during the week.

Not having a huge appetite, I kept my order simple: Tandoori Prawn and basmati. The prawn were large and cooked to perfection. They were juicy with a hint of crunch and lots of flavor - quite delicious! That said, I did find them to be salty but overall, I really enjoyed these shrimp. I don't have much to say about the rice - it was good. My friend ordered the Chicken Tikka, which was served in large chunks, and was very tender.  To complete the meal, I ordered a cup of Chai - it was quite underwhelming. It was lacking in flavor and I couldn't really taste the spiciness of the Chai. Also, way too much milk. 

The reason I gave this place a 3 is because the service sucked. First of all, our waiter had ADD - he couldn't keep our orders straight (we were only 3 people) and after taking our main order (and writing it down), he came back twice to confirm what we'd ordered. The same thing happened when we ordered dessert. I found him to be a little brisk and indifferent, and while he didn't check in on us often, when he did, he came off as pushy. As well, I'm pretty sure he forgot about us because after we finished our meal, it took about 25 minutes for him to come over to see if we wanted anything else (i.e. dessert, tea etc.). When we were done, and finally got our bill, there were mistakes on all three. We asked that these be corrected and the rude waiter (different from above) begrudgingly acquiesced. When he came back, our bills were still wrong - but according to him it didn't matter because 'it's only a few dollars so no big deal.' Really? So this establishment thinks it's acceptable to over-charge their clients because it's 'only a few dollars' that THEY pocket? When I told the guy what I thought of his attitude, he blew me off and walked away in a huff. Someone new came to our table - I assume it was the manager or owner - and took us to the bar to pay. While he was very courteous and willing to correct our bills (with no attitude - which was appreciated), I doubt that I'll be going back to Sahib.

This is an ok Indian restaurant for Montreal, but a good Indian resto for the West Island.  There are only a few food options served during the buffet, but don't worry, they are the common ones i.e. nan, butter chicken, samosas, beef curry...

At Indian buffets, I typically go for the butter chicken, but, I didn't like the taste of it here ... it really tasted like it was just tomato sauce.  My lunch companion said it didn't taste tomato sauce-like at all and that it was actually his fave butter chicken.  I think maybe it's because I've only known the sauce to be creamy-like.  The samosas was kinda bland.  I tried it with the tamarind sauce, but the sauce seemed, and tasted water down....again, maybe it's because I am used to something thicker.

The service was good; my water was always re-filled, and the plates were always cleared.

Went for the lunch buffet, and arrived just as they were opening, so the food was ""just put out"". But some of the sauces already had that top layer of ""fat?"", so must have been sitting there long. My mom called ahead to ask if everything was fresh, and they said yes, absolutely. Something is suspicious here.

They had a nice variation of food, and I tried almost everything. It was pretty much all tasteless, except for the separate 6 sauce area that's supose to be an add on to anything. Those were the only things with flavor, but what's the point in relying on only that for taste? The dishes themselves are supose to be the main event. This was like cafeteria quality.

The naan bread was good, as well as the thin crispy bread. At least they have that going for them.

All the meat dishes were very dry and had a tough texture, even the ""lamb"". But the butter chicken was very tender, just the sauce was super bland, unfortunately.

They had a big thing of white bazmatti rice, with pieces of carmelized onion, as a base for the entres, but the rice was very greasy, and tasteless as well, and the saucy entree dishes didn't give it any taste either. 

The rice pudding had a very odd texture to it. The fruit cocktail was obviously canned, and not good. The fried sweet balls of dough were oversaturated with some sort of greasy like syrop pool, and gave an awkward texture.

I've had plenty of different home cooked indian dishes before, which is why I love indian food. As a restaurant, they should be better than home cooking, or else what's the point in coming?

This is a good place for old people to eat, since flavor can overwhelm the pallet, so bland helps. Also good for drunk people, since grease helps alchohol move along. They had a cool looking bar.

After eating, we sat for a good 30 min, waiting for a waiter to make eye contact with us, which oddly they kept avoiding, might be because the place was getting more people. They were really polite and nice otherwise. When I finally caught one's attention, they explained that we had to go to the front desk at the bar to pay. ok... and when i personally handed the waiter a 5$ bill as tip, he didn't keep it, he put it in the cash register. Maybe it was because the owner was behind me and they're not allowed to keep tips? Very strange.

When my mom called earlier, to also ask about the pricing and if anything extra needed to be paid (I dunno why), they said no tip is required since it's a buffet, but if we wanted to tip that's ok. I guess I won't be tipping next time since it seem like the waiters don't get to keep the tips anyway... The food sucked, the restaurant doesn't deserve my tip money, that was supose to go to the waiter for tending my table. 

Not sure if I'll come back. I asked a friend who ordered from their take out menu, and they said eventhough it was different dishes from their buffet selection, the quality was the same. So I guess this is not authentic indian  cuisine, like they point out on their adv. It's more like white-man dimmed down versions of their national dishes. So sad. What a waste of calories

In the strip mall  Trans Canada highway (HWY 49) and St Jeans  near the Toys R Us. Well we have heard that they have great hamburgers . We were greeted nicely by Sara and our server Mike was very helpful . You can build your own burger or order from one of their creations. The nice thing is that they have a lot of condiments that are free not like other Hamburger restaurants that charge for mayo or BBQ sauces (the nickel and dimmers) . They have a lot of add ons to choose from price range $1&$4 
Eggs, pulled pork , onion rings (see menu attached).
Well I decide to go with the Holy Swiss . It was great . The hamburger was cooked nicely and had a lot of onions and cheese and was hot and fresh. My companion order the Poseidon fish burger on an onion roll . The fish was fresh and tasty and crusted. It was amazing . We shared a basket of onion rings which were crispy and hot . The drippings sauce which we tried 4 of them secret sauce, bbq sauce , tandoori mayo, and the ranch chipotle. Were all good 
If you are not a hamburger lover they hot dogs, grilled cheese , chicken, club sandwiches, salads, poutine and even a brunch menu.

This West Island landmark opened in 1980 and there has been almost no renovations since. Giant flat screen tvs and free wifi are the only modern signs. 
The decor, color scheme of burnt orange/maroon is very on trend with the 70s as are the menu offerings and general feel of Bar B Barn. It's quite possibly the oddest restaurant I've ever stepped foot in. The food arrives on wheeled carts and the plates are melamine, probably the same ones used 30 years ago since they are dull, yellowed and scratched. Cheapens the food. For a sit down restaurant, they really should invest in normal dining ware.

Enough about the decor, the food must be great since they pride themselves in ""the worlds best ribs"" right? What a bold statement. It's hit or miss. Our ribs were not fall off the bone and seemed to be reheated. These are not your traditional BBQ smoky flavored ribs, they are extremely sweet and my first thought upon tasting was that these are like ribs from an Americanized Chinese buffet. You know the kind of place that serves little hot dogs wrapped in bacon dipped in that brown sweet sauce?- well the Bar B Barn ribs and all their sauces have that sweet flavor. I personally liked it, and also enjoyed my chicken although it was nothing special. I was however disappointed at how small the portions were in terms of sides.
I opted for 2 side dishes and there's even the option to get 3 different sides but what's misleading is that you're getting smaller portions of each item, not more food. 
Warning: the mashed potatoes are very sweet since they are mixed with mashed carrots and you only get an ice cream scoops worth. Same with the rice and about 5 onion rings. If you want more food, you need to specify that you're willing to pay extra for additional sides. 

It's a simple menu (I posted pictures of all the prices and selection) I wasn't expecting too much from the exterior of the restaurant but was hoping to be surprised by the food, considering their success and decades of operation. It's ok for the price I paid, my chicken meal was just 10$ but if you're getting their 30$ ribs plate, it's not worth it. 
For me it was mostly an interesting experience to be thrown into a decade from before I was born.",Bar-B Barn,3300 Boulevard des Sources,Pointe-Claire,QC,Pointe-ClaireQC,H9B 1Z7,45.482614,-73.796074,3.0,15,"Barbeque, Restaurants, Chicken Shop"

They charge 4$ for sharing which I'm not a huge fan of. The portions were huge but very tasty. If you like ""traditional"" BBQ this probably won't be your cup of tea. The ribs are parboiled and have a sweet sticky sauce. I happen to be a fan of this method so I was happy to chow down on the ribs. The chicken was delicious as well plump, juicy, well seasoned!

I've been to the Bar B Barn in downtown Montreal maybe 3 times but that was over 20 years ago. There was no particular reason why I didn't return there since except for the fact that there are so many restaurants downtown and even if I work downtown I am sometimes worried about the time required to eat at a sit down full service restaurant.

I knew the general area of this Bar B Barn and drove there using my GPS. I was expecting it to be inside the large mall on Sources but it was across the street. There was ample free parking on the day that we went for lunch.

I arrived and was immediately greeted by the hostess/server who asked me how many people. I looked around and since my friend didn't arrive yet, I told her two but I would wait until my friend showed up.

He showed up within a few minutes and we were quickly shown to a table. The server showed up and asked if we decided what we wanted. Since it was my first time in this restaurant, I mentioned I would take a few minutes. I was a bit surprised that we weren't offered any water when we sat down (nor did we get any water throughout our time dining there). She then described what the lunch special was which sounded good. We decided to get the 3 ribs lunch special where we opted for fries. It also came with a small piece of bread and with Spanish rice (or rice with some type of tomato sauce with it). It also came with a small fountain drink. We opted for Diet Pepsi.

The food came out very fast. I'm not sure if this was because it wasn't crowded/busy on the day that we went. As others mentioned in their reviews, the ribs were on the sweet side. I personally didn't have an issue with it and enjoyed it. The only other place that I've regularly ordered ribs would be at Baton Rouge. Bar B Barn's ribs are bigger in size but they aren't as ""fall of the bone"" ribs as Baton Rouge's ribs. Bar B Barn's ribs were not difficult to eat but unlike Baton Rouge's ribs, you can just use your fork to eat it so it did get a bit messier since I had to use my fingers (which was fine with me).

The fries were good (crinkle cut fries) and the rice was also good.

After finishing, the server came and asked us if we wanted something else. My friend was running late for work so we both decided not to get anything else. She asked if it would be two bills or one and we both said two. She came back with our bills and brought a portable credit card machine.

All in all, it was a good experience.",Bar-B Barn,3300 Boulevard des Sources,Pointe-Claire,QC,Pointe-ClaireQC,H9B 1Z7,45.482614,-73.796074,3.0,15,"Barbeque, Restaurants, Chicken Shop"

I was skeptical of recent reviews about the food would only trust my own taste buds when benchmarking a pub which I hold in high esteem. Unfortunately, I have to agree that the food has taken a downturn. My sweet potato fries tasted stale and twice fried. It's a shame because greasy foods are what fodders my drinking and what will ultimately push me to buy just one more round.

Salt is a flavor enhancer. If they don't put flavor into the food, then adding salt at our table just makes it salty...

All the food they brought to us looked very impressive and very well put together. Nothing was dry, all was very moist and tender, just bland as fk. None of us was happy with our meals and they're not cheap! So we were shocked.

The place is beautiful and very spacious. The waiters were extremly kind and patient, but the hostess was awful. She was argumentative in trying to seat us in a certain area, which I imagine would be more convinient for the staff, I understand the logic behind that, but the table she put us at had really high chairs that my mom just couldn't climb up into. So we had to find this hostess again and tell her this, then she put us in a booth in a different section. I didn't like her demeanor at all. It wasn't friendly, it was more snappy, pushy, bitchy and in a hurry like she must have been over-stressed and couldn't afford any patience on anyone. It wasn't late and the restaurant wasn't packed or even crowded... I guess she was stressed about the rush that was expected to come? Still, it was awkward for us, like she didn't really care.

I liked how their menu shows you which beers to pair the food with, I thought that was a lot of fun. I tried their white beer which was nice at first but then felt almost salty, so I ordered their dark beer after which the waiter encouraged me to try their new ""german"" type which was off the hook ^_^

Because their meals were bland, we cancelled all our desert plans (since their menu looked incredible) and just played it safe by splitting one of their deserts which turned out to be ""cheesecake"" served in 3 different flavored small jars. It was nothing special and very cheaply made. I was sad that their impressively sounding beer caramel sauce didn't really taste of beer, though my brother was able to tell it had a hint of it.

The sound of beer battered fries was very exciting and new to me, but I didn't notice any taste of beer in them. They just tasted like regular fries with a crispy layer on top, very dull and boring. Even the mayo on the side was bland, which was fkn weird.

All in all, this is just expensive Quebecer hipster pub food. It's not real food. Looks and sounds amazing, but tastes like nothing. You need to add ketchup and mustard on everything, which defies the entire purpose of paying these prices. Very, very sadening.

KICKED OUT BY POLICE AND TOLD NEVER TO RETURN because on our first beer we chinked glasses and one was still too hot from the dishwasher and broke spilling beer all over my laptop and friends expensive coat. I asked for assistance and the Director Sam told us to be more careful because we just broke a glass. This was untrue and he had mistaken us for another table so he apologized. But then when our appetizers were set down on the table the Manager Alex told us that the waitstaff did not want to serve us and he IMMEDIATELY asked us to leave. 

When we asked why he said it does not matter and began shouting ""THIS IS MY RESTAURANT AND IT DOESN'T MATTER WHY -- I AM ASKING YOU TO LEAVE! THIS IS A PRIVATE ESTABLISHMENT AND NOW YOU ARE TRESPASSING!"" I even have a video of him doing this. Then the ""Director Sam"" came out and said ""We are backing up the waitstaff decision and you must leave"" and he called the police.

So, we waited for the police to arrive and they were completely baffled as to why we needed to leave but did politely inform us that it is the law. We immediately went to the nearby Keg where you can expect to be treated like an upstanding citizen.

Other than that -- the last 4 visits our drinks were wrong, the food was wrong, we were overcharged, the kitchen staff was brand new, the management was consistently buying us drinks to compensate; and because of a HEALTH CODE VIOLATION I spotted they took $100 off one of our visits.

But tonight was the last straw and we are done. They have a couple of very good waiters but the bar staff and more critically, the management, is just rude and in need of a reset of what customers mean for their business and livelihood. We made reservations for 7:30 tonight but they first could not find our name... then it turned up but written in a piece of flying paper rather than in their 1980 appointment book.... Despite our reservations, time continued to elapse and they never bothered to keep us updated on when we would be seated... instead any mention of wanting to be seated was a bother and an imposition. After 45 minutes a lady who appears to be the owner proceeded to explain to us that reservations are just an approximation and that we shouldn't expect to be seated on time... the barmaid had already rationalized with us that a party of 6 (like us) had arrived after us but had been seated before us because they made their reservations before us (as disorganized as they were I doubt they could tell when each reservation was actually placed...). The true fact is that they had a wedding party having dinner that night and each bad experience we have had there has been when they were over 50% full or with one large table bogging down the system. The kitchen cannot get the dishes out fast enough and comes to a screeching halt which then in turn messes up all the other patrons orders and creates a giant delay. But instead of making appropriate changes for that or at least owning up to their delays, acknowledging we should be seated earlier than 45 minutes after our reservation time... the owner / manager was hell bent on explaining to our group of 6 how we should wait and be quiet and our expectations were just completely irrational.... nicely done!

Our waitress (unfortunately I forgot her name) was nice and efficient even though we had her running around a bit. When you have kids there's always something they need (ie. extra napkins, more water, extra plate, more utensils) I'm sure all parents understand. She was always glad to help out and always had a smile.

People that complain about cholesterol and what not need to go get a life. Order something healthy then. I can't stand when people order eggs, bacon, potatoes and then complain that they are greasy. Breakfast in my opinion is eggs, pancakes, bacon, toast, ham etc. If you're looking for bran flakes, then stay home.

The buckwheat crepes weren't special, and I find that their cheeses taste cheap. It wasn't bad but it wasn't that good either. I will say that their potatoes are pretty good though.

This would have to be my 11th visit to a Allo Mon Coco, but, this is my 10th visit to this West Island location.

I enjoy the food here; I always try a different plate each time that I visit.  

What is consistent here at the West Island location is the poor customer service.  I have come here with my bf, or with a party of 3, 4 and even 8 (with 2 children), and we've been seated at various tables. 

The majority of the waiters/waitresses and hostess really don't give a hoot about the clients.  No welcoming reception, no interest in taking orders.... the majority of the staff are young and appear to be disengaged.  (I've witnessed staff gossiping/saying unpleasant things at the entrance about clients in front of other clients!  One time, I waited at the very front of the line for a table, next to the hostess, for 1 hour waiting on a table for 3... clients who have arrived after me were being seated before me, and when I asked the hostess how long would it be for the next table of 3 to be available, I looked down at her paper with the list of names and number in a party, and I saw that my name was scratched out - her response to that was that she had called my name but no one responded to it and so she gave my table away.  I said that's impossible because I was at the front of the line the whole time... next to her!)

Anyway, back to this visit - I ordered the bacon and tomato omelet.  It was good.  It is served with toast, a small watermelon and grapefruit slice, and potatoes.  With a lack of  other words to describe the potatoes, I'd say they are mash potato-ish.  Very good. You may ask for the potatoes to be well-done - which means less ""mash potato-like"" and more of a fried/crispy texture.  For an extra cost, you may have cheese on top of the potatoes.  The plate is a generous serving, so come hungry!  The coffee is very good too.

The only other location I've been to is at Dix 30 - a whole different other demographic over there...and a small/tight place...no elbow room, but the food was good there.

[There are 2 good waiter/waitress who works there - I do pray that you get seated in their section.  They are the 2 more older of the wait staff.  I really would have given at least another star to this place, but as a whole, the customer service was just not good enough.]",Allo Mon Coco,46-D Boulevard Brunswick,Pointe-Claire,QC,Pointe-ClaireQC,H9R 4W3,45.4819489947,-73.7968845952,3.5,32,"Breakfast & Brunch, Restaurants"

Unarguably the worst area on the island to find an edible, let alone enjoyable, breakfast. Thank heaven...that's no longer the case. Allo Mon Coco has ridden to the rescue...out of Laval of all places. Anyone living or working west of Decarie who chooses to eat breakfast anywhere else in the area is - let me say this politely - an ass (or from South Western Ontario, which when it comes to food is pretty much the same thing)
Allo Mon Coco packs em in every morning in Laval but when I walked into the cavernous new location on Brunswick west of Sources just after 8 I was the only patron in the restaurant. That won't last but until word gets out and the lineups start forming I'll take advantage of the lull.
The menu is pretty standard breakfast fare with a few twists but the execution is what separates these guys from the wannabes. Two examples:
My eggs Benedict came with potatoes and fruit - potatoes the neither the McCain brothers not the good folks in Cavendish had touched with their ""lets process out every but of value and taste"" hands. Real potatoes - go figure.
The fruit bowl was a meal in itself - not a couple of ""sliced last week"" shards of mellon. I couldn't eat it all. The waitress packed it to go and then I promptly forgot it.

The service on the other hand is, frankly, abysmal. Today for the first time in my life I got up and walked out of a restaurant leaving the meal barely touched. That was after waiting for someone to take my order (i eventually had to track down the hostess, who eventually sent a waitress who said she was ""just informed"" there was a customer at the booth. Another ridiculous wait for the food - again only coming once I complained to a staff member (the one waitress in the place that seems to genuinely care) to be followed by another wait for toast while everything else went cold. After almost 40 minutes I lost patience and walked out.

I could blame the hostess and the waitress, both of whom could be kindly described as indifferent and probably more accurately categorized as both lazy and indifferent. They don't deserve blame though. They were only doing what comes naturally to staff when the management stops managing.

I'll give the owner(s) some unsolicited advice. 
One: 
Try spending some time in your store. The staff (especially the young ones) wander around aimlessly with no desire or understanding of what is expected. When a waitress tells me she needed someone to notify her she had a customer  I really wonder if she ever bothers to look at her station. That's so bush you should be ashamed of how little you put into training and follow-up.
Two
Put someone on hostess duties who is actually going to greet customers within a couple of minutes and knows the extent of her (his) job. Currently you've got a parade of amateurs  - usually waiters or waitresses who have their own jobs to do. Alternately ask the person who seats customers to inform them that they are now being abandoned. At least prepare the customer for the rest of the non-service coming their way.
Three
If you really don't care about your restaurant - sell it. The food is good. There are some staff members who really do care about doing a good job. Before you kill a good thing at least profit from it.
Four
If you actually do care about your store. Get your ass off the couch and get back to work. Clean house. Light a fire under the lazy ones and if they still don't rise to the job boot them out. Inspire the good ones to meet your standards (you'll need to show everyone that you actually have those standards - something not currently evident)

777,R32opA7V4CRj8fqj6BI3jw,hAoNITpnIOMgNTzjbBig6Q,2,1,1,"Arrived at 10:00 A.M. Sunday morning, while waiting for a friend to show I had several choices of an outside table. Not the most picturesque patio but it certainly beats the clamorous cafeteria style of the interior. The wall of cut popular trees helps remarkable well in hiding the parking lot just inches away. The waiters and waitresses were quick, attentive, friendly, helpful and busier than buzzards on a carcass. The tables were speedily cleaned and somehow the coffee cup (most importantly) never saw the bottom. While there (10-12:00), I observed several (over a two hour period) long lines of people (mostly groups of four to six) waiting for tables who'd first arrived around 10:30. For the most part the people were quickly seated as tables became available. It was a great summers Sunday morning of a long weekend and everyone was in great spirits waiting patiently for their turn at the trough. If possible, arrive closer to 10:00 especially if you want to be outside.

My friend had the mushroom omelet that was at least two large eggs with a good smattering of sautéed mushrooms. The egg was done to perfection, light, buttery, not a singe mark to be seen. I would've liked to have seen a little more finesse though. An omelet should encompass its main component by being folded over. Sautéing the mushrooms in fresh garlic and chive with a small amount of smoked salt would've been ideal. However, his report is that it was a tasty omelet and that is what counts most. The plate was heaped with a Mont Saint-Sauveur size helping of browned potato which was nicely seasoned with a buttery flavour. The hash browns (not the typical style) stood on their own not needing any added condiments, fresh ground white or black pepper would've elevated the potatoes a notch. The plate also came with a good portion of fresh cut watermelon and grapefruit. $11.xx tax included is a very reasonable price.

I was not feeling hungry so ordered toast with coffee, coffee that had appeared as we sat down. I was surprised to be presented with a full plate. Two thick slices of brown toast well buttered (as ordered) a mountain of creamy hashed potatoes (as above), two decent sized pieces of fresh cut fruit, again watermelon and grapefruit, must of been on sale, lol. It was a meal and far more than I'd intended on eating. But as the scintillating conversation continued, my arms moved in an automaton fashion keeping me very happy during my attentive listening phases. Jams for the toast were a nice (not gourmet by any stretch) selection of orange marmalade, blueberry of which I partook it was good, strawberry, and peanut butter to round out the choices. All this for a whopping $4.54 tax included.

A little more attention to detail in the cooking would up the ante a bit. I am not a fan of the loud cafeteria style ambiance, I get the easy clean motif but really, I'd fire the designer. Sound dampening materials are not that expensive while under construction and cost effective methods are easily implemented afterwards. I cannot bring myself at this stage to garner more than three stars overall. But we will be coming back and my friend will be bringing his wife there for her birthday this next weekend. In the West Island, their biggest completion is Chez Cora on Hymus at what will become known as the Target mall (not a real mall of course) in Pointe Claire. Another nice touch was the waitress asking if we wanted the fruit included. I really appreciate the waste not want not attitude.

This restaurant this time of year had some really nice decorations.  I'm not sure if the birch branches are always there on the outside but inside they had both Christmas and Hanukkah but even without the decor the interior has a really nice open space with very high ceilings.

There are plenty of booths here some large so you have a bit of privacy and coziness feel to it even though it's very bright inside.

The menu is in both French and English if you flip it over and each section is separated into breakfast, kid's menu and lunch.

The menu is very large which a variety of combinations with eggs, meat, pancakes, bagels, crepes, fruit etc.  It sort of reminds me of a Cora's (Chez Cora in QC) but nicer.

I ordered the Gourmand/Guzzler (French and English names on the menu) which is the first item on the menu for breakfast.  Included are 2 eggs cooked to order, bacon, ham, sausage, potatoes, toast and 2 pancakes and coffee was included for 13.25.  I added cheese to the potatoes for 3 dollars as well. 

The breakfast is huge.  It's a very large meal for the first meal of the day and considering how much food it is, it's enough to skip lunch, for me at least.

The restaurant was half empty during my visit but I still had to wait 30 minutes to be brought coffee, a big no no for any visit to a breakfast place in my opinion. We tried several times to make eye contact with one of the other servers who were obviously avoiding to even glance in the direction of tables they weren't serving and were cleaning off tables instead. 

Once our server did come to see us, he was great, attentive and checked in often. I had the avocado eggs Benedict which was really good and I love that the fruit bowl that comes with the dish is an actual good mix of fruit, not just the cheap slices. There was banana, strawberries, blueberries, cantaloupe, melon and blackberries.

We had crab cakes which were excellent with nice crispy exteriors and light, fluffy and flavorful interiors.  They were served with chipotle mayonnaise with just the right amount of heat to complement and not overwhelm the delicate crab taste.  I Also tried their appetizer of ""escargots bourgogne"" which were escargots and mushrooms lightly braised in wine (just like beef bourgogne) and topped with a piece of smoked bison belly which was advertized as ""bacon"".  The escargot were a little overwhelmed by the wine sauce and the braising didn't do much for their texture.  The saving grace was the bison belly which was braised right along with the escargot and mushrooms and was spectacular.  I could have eaten a larger piece as a main course.  It was loaded with flavor and was soft and luscious as a braised piece of belly should be.  They do themselves a disservice simply referring to this as a bacon topping in the menu!!
I've also sampled two mains - the venison which was beautifully cooked and presented in a lovely reduction.  It was venison as venison is meant to be served.  I also had the ""duck two ways"", which was a duck confit and duck breast.  The breast was delicious and again cooked perfectly and served with a mashed potato with a little parsnip that was heavenly - the two vegetables were beautifully balanced together..  The confit however was disappointingly hard and lacked any skin or crispiness so a real disappointment.  My wife had a risotto which was very average.
At both meals I asked for wine recommendations - the first was spot on and the second very disappointing so also a little hit and miss.",Le Gourmand,42 Rue Sainte-Anne,Pointe-Claire,QC,Pointe-ClaireQC,H9S 4P8,45.42924,-73.825997,4.5,21,"Chinese, Cantonese, French, Restaurants, Bars, Wine Bars, Nightlife"

It turned out the building was indeed old - built in 1847 from local stone; it served as residences for multiple families over the years; even a blacksmith shop. A hundred years later it finally became a restaurant in the picturesque lakeside town of Pointe-Claire.

We were here for our final work dinner after a somewhat-grueling business trip; and the smaller group and surroundings made this a more cozy, intimate affair than previous dinners. We were led to our own space in the upstairs area, near a crackling fireplace, where we proceeded to order cocktails. (They had a local stout on the menu, so I had to get that first).

The menu was small but excellent (the best kind). i was momentarily torn, but in about 30 seconds the decision was easy: they had venison; which is always a no-brainer for me.

-- Red Deer in mushroom sauce: Fantastic; and probably the best venison dish I've ever had.  It was not only tender; but lean and flavorful. Not gamey (even though I'm usually OK with a little). It was served over delicious potatoes with a side of perfect green beans. I actually felt sorry for some of my compatriots, who ordered something else. They liked their dishes, but were not as thrilled as I.

Then came dessert. i had actually eaten so well during the week (with little exercise) that I declined, despite the great choices (creme brûlée, apple tart, profiterole, chocolate torte, etc). I ordered a nice glass or port and a coffee instead and enjoyed the oohs, aahs and spirited conversation with my co-workers.

This is my most favourite restaurant since they opened and I love to go there winter , spring or summer on the wonderful terrace.
So last week, my boyfriend booked and took me for my birthday. We were sat upstairs , taking an early reservation as it was just before Christmas.
Long story short, there was a party of 22 booked upstairs, they were in bar when we started our meal.
The waiter was frazzled preparing the table, going up and down the stairs and had very little time or patience for us.
He said we should enjoy the peace while we could?
Then the group came up. It was deafening, we couldn't talk and it was awful, another small group asked to move 
But weren't allowed.
It was awful, my boyfriend felt so bad.
Although the food was delicious as usual, the service and atmosphere were just awful.
The manager came up twice, pulled a face as if to say "" yikes it's noisy"" laughed and left.

I went there for lunch to celebrate a birthday. We decided to go at 1:00 to avoid the lunch rush - it was the right move. 

When we arrived there was a steady stream of people leaving. We were five plus two children (a toddler and a five-year-old) - I have to point out that this isn't the place for children (no highchairs available), however they were accommodating   - even bringing crayons and a colouring pad for the little one.

We all ordered from the lunch menu which came with a choice of Salad or Soup - everyone picked the Salad which consisted of baby greens, sliced cucumber and alas winter tomatoes (not ripe), the dressing was a basic balsamic emulsion. Two of us ordered the Mussles and Belgian frites - both cooked perfectly - the mussles were in a nice broth. It would be nice to be given a choice of mayo or ketchup for the fries. Two ordered the Capellini and Meatballs. We had to ask for Parmesan it wasn't automatically offered.  And finally one ordered a Roast Beef Sandwich - it came with the frites and a dipping sauce. Everyone gave the food a thumbs up and all the portions were very generous. 

Service was a littler slow - our server kept disappearing for long periods; she was very nice though and was even dancing with the baby at one point - so cute.  My lunch came to just under $17 including taxes and a Perrier.

This place has been around for many years and is still seems to be going strong, so kudos to them. One drawback was the state of the washroom - in all fairness we did arrive after the busy lunch rush, but still.

Well worth it, good bang for your buck - I haven't been in awhile but glad I rediscovered the place and plan to go back for dinner and to sample the Vodka emporium.

Where to begin... 
-The smoked meat was mediocre at best. 
-The beer was expensive. 
-The beer on tap options were super limited. 
-The fries were just okay. 
-Table d'hôte dessert was just plain bad.

I ordered the Reuben sandwich and it was decent, but the smoked meat wasn't great. My 2 lunch dates had the smoked meat sandwiches on the table d'hôte and were both disappointed with their food. 

For a deli & ""bar"", the beer selection is pitiful. Most restaurants have more beer on tap than Moe's does.  Pitchers for $21 (or a 20oz glass for $7.25) are not such a great deal...  I expected better prices for a place with ""bar"" in its name.  If you don't like the tap options, your choices of bottled beer are plentiful, but at $8 a bottle, it's hard to get excited about it.

838,_hq9AwHVBkwHM0eK8aG8yg,K0QXbMnH3ZVgg-0EuGYT9Q,1,0,0,"A local counterpart of mine said a trip to Montreal would not be complete without a smoked meat sandwich. Running short on time and wanting to stay relatively close to the airport Moe's was a great option. 

Luckily we made it for just as happy hour was starting so small beers were on special!

I ordered the jumbo smoked meat sandwich which came with cole slaw and fries. 

The sandwich was simple; Bread, Meat and Mustard. simplistic and tasty but not mind blowing.  Yes, the sandwich was jumbo but it was not match for me. I killed all 3 components and still had room for a few beers..

For those like me who have never had this Montreal delicacy, the best descriptor I can think of for smoked meat is it's similar to a salt beef sandwich that you would get in the UK. In addition  you use regular yellow mustard on this vs brown mustard like it's Brit counterpart. 

I still prefer a Reuben over smoked meat/salt beef. But would still recommend this place for out of towners for a smoked meat experience.

For me, the notes of cinnamon/nutmeg/allspice (coupled with plain sugar...?) in the sauce was a complete turnoff, as was the carb-bomb of a crust that will sit in your stomach like a brick.

Let me explain a bit more: my daughter has a corn allergy and it's difficult for us to find quick, easy to make, packaged food that is filling, corn free, and safe for her to eat. She loves and eats these tiny little pies like candy. Normally, they're not hard to find, Amy's is a brand that is completely engrained in Natural and Regular food stores all over Canada and the US. In most cities, you can easily find entire sections filled with these pies... and other corn safe food. 

But, not in Pierrefonds. When we first moved to Montréal, we discovered that many of the foods/brands that we took for granted in other cities were simply not available in Québec (or so we were told). I was told by one store (Provigo) that if we wanted many of the corn allergy safe brands that we'd have to drive to Ottawa to get them. It was like being thrown back 7-years to a time where we were pre-making all our food every week from scratch and freezing it... and driving to several smaller shops to find ingredients.

When a friend told us about Tau, it was like being thrown a life line. They're similar to Whole Foods in the brands they carry; and, they also go around to the local businesses and bring in homemade food (many of it corn free). From here we've been able to learn more about our community and local corn-safe businesses. 

To be able to shop for food without having to worry is a tremendous gift and for that reason we love Tau.

They offer a huge variety of coffees, teas and sandwiches for either lunch or breakfast. They also always have specials that work in accordance with the current season. The owner is always there and is alway happy to help his customers with anything they might need. The customer service and the people are always friendly and nice. There is always a long line, but it goes pretty quickly. 

The little studio has an open bar which helps to bring in a different clientele rather than just the breakfast and brunch crowd. The events that this place can hold are great too because of the open bar and the kitchen in the back. It is the perfect little spot for a family gathering. 

The only thing that I would suggest needs to be worked on is the freshness of the pies. Today when I was there I ordered a piece of their pecan pie. I was a little disappointed because the pie crust wasn't flaky like it should be. It was pretty hard to cut through and that made it a little disappointing. But usually everything there is on point. So I wold suggest that the pies to be more flaky is to make them fresh the day or night before. Anything you do not use, maybe give it to someone who might not be able to eat it.

One had a flank steak (or flat iron steak), fries were really tasty and the steak was good, cooked perfectly, a little chewy but very tasty, one had the lamb chops (or small lamb roast, not sure what they cal it ) - apparently this was excellent.

How can I review this restaurant ...
First of all , the food was disgusting and expensive.

 In fact , I had a take out order of a souvlaki combo. Well , my plate that usually comes with a salad in any Greek establishment was not there . Instead , I had a souvlaki which meat was not even cooked properly as it was still reddish . Then , this came with a pack of fries that came from McCain frozen food -- absolutely garbage as it was full of salt . It was not even worth taking a picture for future customers to see.

Add another aspect of something I really disliked . My order took 20-25 mins to be made and given to me . Seriously ? It's a day week and the restaurant was not busy . I saw a man who knew the manager or boss walked in after me for a take out order and was served before me ? Moreover, I've asked the person who took my order whether it was possible to have water instead of a soft drink , she told me it was possible , and instead she charged me for the water without warning me , thanks a lot I felt conpletly deceived .
How is this acceptable . I worked in the restaurant industry for years and such service can be describe as complete crap and unprofessional .

Honestly If I could I would give this restaurant zero stars as it's take out standards are garbage . Various coworkers of my office have also told me to avoid this restaurant and thereby , following my experience, I do not recommend it to anyone .

 Avoid at all costs , you'll be served a lot faster, with more food and a cheaper price at fairview'a food court upstairs.",Le Deli de Fairview,6801 Route Transcanadienne,Pointe-Claire,QC,Pointe-ClaireQC,H9R 4Y8,45.4628657,-73.8306662,3.0,5,"Delis, Restaurants"

Not me.
I pointed to the upper section and the semingly annoyed man host brought us to the table of our choice.
Better table, but their menu is way too massive...it is  beyond heavy for certain people to even hold.

This section was much better, but it came with the coldest , uncharismatic, robotic server I have ever had the unfortunate chance of getting.
There was no greeting involved, he just pivoted from his other table and asked me in a low mumble ""Do you want me to bring you a beer?"" 
I asked him if he was actually talking to me, then asked him
 ""How about presenting yourself first and addressing all 4 of us?""
How about ""Hello, my name is Chris, can I offer you....""
He looked annoyed.

Our catatonic waiter Chris actually ended his lackluster performance by switching the bill's numbers on the interac machine from  $47...to $74...!!!

I hadn't been to Scarolie's for quite some time but stopped in this past weekend for dinner. I ordered the grilled shrimp with rice and roasted vegetables.

It was obvious just by looking at the roasted vegetables that these had been re-warmed or re-grilled; they were certainly not cooked recently because they were very dry and they just looked OLD. They also lacked in flavor so I didn't even eat them. The wild rice was very good but then, it's not that hard to make rice. I'm not sure about the shrimp - I got the feeling that they weren't grilled right before serving the dish because they were a little tough.

Personally, I sometimes think their menu has too many options to read through, so when I'm not in the mood for 'light' reading, I order from the table d'hôte or just go for my favorite dish - the lobster ravioli (lobster-stuffed ravioli, creamy tomato sauce w/peppercorns, sun dried tomatoes and brandy).  If you're lucky, you can sometimes find this dish on the table d'hôte menu with an extra bonus - it's topped with baby shrimp and scallops.  I really enjoy this dish, though have found that on occasion, it wasn't as hot as I would like. 

One thing to note is that they do seem to have a lot of cream-based sauces for an Italian restaurant. I would like to see a few more options utilizing fresh Italian tomatoes, broth, or pesto, as creams tend to be too heavy. 

The table d'hôte usually comes with a starter, coffee/tea and (I think) dessert). The Caesar salad is quite good, though can be a bit heavy on the dressing.

I ordered a kale, mango, asparagus and chicken salad from the list of weekly specials and asked if it was possible to replace the chicken with zucchini, as I am vegetarian. The waiter said that would be no problem. However, when my salad was brought out, it was literally just a pile of romaine lettuce with a handful of grilled zucchini on top... When I finally tracked down the waiter, he tried to tell me that I read the menu wrong and that the salad of the day was actually a seafood salad. The menu clearly said ""Insalata di Pollo Chipotle"". I remember explicitly because I had taken a photo of the menu before ordering. When I told this to the waiter, his response was, ""Yes, pollo. A seafood salad."" What??? Even if it was a seafood salad, it had said it was a kale base with almonds, mango and asparagus and the salad he brought me had no toppings whatsoever.

The waiter offered to go get the menu so I could see *my* mistake.

The Staff... very young and unpolished.  Obviously, it's there first job ""waitering"" and it shows in the greeting, mood, and lack of experience.  Lack of Attentiveness and no concern given to customer service.

Drinks... forget about ordering a cocktail, you will be served sporadically (I mean come on, if 7 people are there, why not deliver and server drinks all at the same time) some of us were served our cocktail 30 minutes after ordering and received during the meal.  Also, for $10 for a cosmo, how can you get it wrong... I mean come on, if you have the b@lls to charge $10, you better get it bang on or your opening yourself up to be criticized.

We ordered as a starter, Calamari... they were rubbery and greasy.  Most places get it wrong, but this place really got it wrong.  If you tried Marvins back in the day, you will know what I mean (now, even Marvin gets the standard industrial looking cuts of calamari instead of the fresh stuff).

Mains... The 8 Oz Sirloin cut was a complete 0.  Tough, grainy and very fibery cut of beef.  If you could UN_Tenderize a cut of beef, this Chef has the recipe lol.  OMG, it was unchewable.  I am being serious.  Fish and Chips was very greasy on the batter, and came with greasy thin string cut fries that were all about 1 - 1 1/2 inches in length (just weird, since they were crammed in a mini frier looking decorative basket that was 4 x 4 x 5 inches in length.  I am too believe they do not heat there frier oil high enough so the oil soaks into the batter instead of cooking and sealing the batter pours (which by cooking this way, prolongs the frier oil instead of frying at higher temperatures to produce less greasy food).  Pizza Margherita was very commercial tasting dough and sauce, but it did have fresh sliced tomatoes on top, not enough to mask the dough and sauces non freshness.  Chicken was the best of the bunch, but if Your hungry the portion is quiet small so you better order two if you didn't get served bread (We had to ask for bread 2x to receive it once, and asked many times during the meal for water refill) and if you didn't order any starters.

No hello or thank you when leaving the restaurant (he was standing at the front desk, while an employee was taking a reservation on the phone).

I do have a quick disclaimer, however: I've never eaten here; we didn't even make it that far. The incident began as we entered the parking lot. We were waiting for another car to exit a parking space in front of us. As soon as the car left, a black Porsche Cayenne raced into the lot and took our spot (mind you, the roads were icy, and the driver was being very reckless, especially given the conditions. But I digress). When confronted about it, the woman who was driving the car told my father he ""should learn how to drive"" and was generally very rude to him and dismissive of his complaint. Attempting to end the altercation with what we thought was simply a fellow patron, we told her to have a nice meal and walked into the restaurant. She replied with a smug ""No, YOU enjoy your meal"". Honestly, I thought that was just some stupid alcohol-induced comeback, but apparently it had some significance, because as she soon told us herself, she was the owner of the restaurant. We later confirmed this with the manger, Phililpe Massadie, who was very apologetic on this woman's behalf. Imagine, she bragged about being the owner having treated us this way. As if it justifies her behaviour! It's unacceptable. As a result, our party of six chose to wait 45 minutes to eat at another establishment instead of giving that woman our money. Bottom line is that the food could have been fantastic, the service could have been impeccable, and the environment could have been perfect, but we will never know and the Towne Hall will never have my business nor the business of any of our family on account of the way we were treated by the owner
 I'd appreciate it if I could receive some message or statement from the owner in reply to this review, but I notice she only replies to positive reviews, so I guess that means she doesn't really care about dissatisfied customers. 

I know this review probably comes off as if I have some personal vendetta against the owner, and to an extent, that's true.

The decor was similar (pseudo-Egyptian plus art deco). Though Towne Hall also added a 'sports bar' vibe around the bar side of this large space - with a few too many giant TVs. In other words: bordering on tacky.

I should probably start by saying I don't care much for the ""dressed-up cattle-call"" that is The Cheesecake Factory chain, (With 90% of the focus on the decor and dessert; not so much on the main courses). So I was wary after i showed up here for a group dinner, saw the decor, and was told the menu had ""something for everybody.""

After our seating, I perused the menu. As advertised, it was very broad, but the choices at Towne Hall were higher-end than I expected, including multiple seafood dishes and apps, plus veal, lamb, and quite a few Italian and Mediterranean choices. i had a little trouble deciding, but eventually settled on the lamb chops and a Greek salad to start. A somewhat easier choice by that time, since the red wine was flowing. 

My salad was excellent - large and fresh. I was pleasantly surprised by the generous quantity of perfect, ripe tomatoes on top, since it was winter in Montreal. (and I am well aware we are spoiled in CA).

My lamb dish was less impressive - The meat had good flavor and seasoning, but was quite tough. It was both hard to cut and hard to chew. I would not get this again.

Being a work dinner, I did not have to pay. But as always, the restaurant gets no extra credit for that.  Considering the OK food and higher prices, I'd think twice about coming here on my own dime, even with the fluffed-up ambiance.",Towne Hall,50 Boulevard Brunswick,Pointe-Claire,QC,Pointe-ClaireQC,H9B 2L3,45.481545,-73.798293,3.5,44,"Modern European, Restaurants"

Good music played, but not loud enough for us to have to yell at each other to hear. Our waiter was very nice and charming. I ordered the fish 'n' chips, served with a small house salad and a small bowl of fries. The fish was pretty good, mind you I would have preferred a little less batter as I barely tasted the fish, but I guess that's the point (?). The salad has a sweet vinaigrette and was refreshing in contrast to the battered fish. The fries were your basic matchstick variety, but I was glad there wasn't a mountain of fries, otherwise I would've left feeling too full. My evening companions had the gnocchi, the red snapper, caesar salad with salmon tartar and a seafood linguini of sorts (respectively).

I've decided that i'm not the biggest fan of ravioli in general, so i'm not going to comment whether it was great. Dessert was amazing.

By far the service was top notch, waiters asked and helped, laughed along our jokes, and was a pleasant experience overall. A little on the pricey side, but good for a celebratory occasion.

The decor is amazing given the fact that the space is virtually a warehouse (its massive!). The waitstaff was professional through and through--never missed a step with anything. 

We had a fix menu because we were a group of 30. I had no part in choosing the menu, but the selections were varied. Everything I had was good. I had salmon carpaccio, a Caesar salad, a bavette steak and fries, and a chocolate soufflé for dessert. Some minor complaints: my Caesar salad had a surprise piece of cold cut (prosciutto? maybe?) hiding in the leaves and gave my mouth a bit of a salty shock, and it was a little overdressed as well; my bavette was perfectly cooked but my French fries left me craving something. I might have preferred some roasted potatoes instead just to make the dish a little classier. The steak was perfectly seasoned, and came with a nice little (I wanna say parsley onion and tomato?) garnish which really evened out the saltiness of the rub. 


My one real criticism of the place--and this may not even be an accurate representation of the menu given that I am basing this review on a menu fixe--is that there seemed to be a lack of cohesion in the menu choices. There was North American food, European food, Asian food, all kind of presented together. At this point I'm nit-picking. 

As well as planning the party goes, my sources told me the staff was more than helpful and made the process as painless as possible.

A green salad that had very little dressy and very dry which I hart time finishing. For the main course I had a white fish. The fish lacked seasoned. I felt like they just poured a dressing over the fish with a few veggies but the fish itself tasted very bland. There was a green side to the fish, I had half a bit. It was pretty bad. It tasted like someone soaked spinach in water, took it out and forgot to drain it, wrapped it in a circle and served it. I wish it was cooked a little. I couldn't even eat it, I was just choking on it. I had a mojito which was good as well. 

I have several food allergies and I was really impressed that they respected that when serving me. 

I absolutely loved the soufflé. I haven't had a soufflé like that in a long long time! We were lastly served with coffee/tea. The coffee was frankly strong but I enjoyed it especially having it just before walking into the cold.

Our table was cleaned and a new runner was placed on the seam (again!), but our wine soaked cutlery wasn't replaced.  I still had high hopes for the food ... 
 
I had the bouillabaisse ($27).  The presentation was nice, served in a (cast iron/ceramic?) pot, with a nice garlic bread crisp.  The bouillabaisse was less of a seafood stew and more of a cooked seafood combo placed in a broth.  The broth was bland and lacked oomph, and the fish cubes weren't  skinned.  There were quite a few mussels, two clams, two large shrimp (a little tough) and two large scallops (nicely cooked). Some fresh herbs, seasoning and simmering the broth would have gone a long way.  My boyfriend had the duck breast with a berry and porto reduction ($25). The sauce was delicious,  but the duck wasn't properly cooked/sliced and was quite tough and overly fatty - one slice contained no meat and was only a slice of fat.  Another friend had the salmon tartare (which looked amazing! Presentation was gorgeous!), but she described the flavour as mediocre at best, and wasn't impressed.  Our waiter didn't check on us after bringing our food.  The cheesecake was good. 

There are much better meals available for the price.  One pays for decor and presentation, but the flavour/cooking was a miss.

.Greg suggested me the seafood pasta and the salmon tartare. 
The tartare was simple but missing some seasoning. this was because you have to eat with the apple decoration. So eat the decoration that will provide you  the chilli kick and green apple crisp. Maybe George can add more apple to the mix ?
.
The grilled octopus was one of my favorite entree . Very well seasoned with the capers , Greek Olive oil and lemon.($$$$)
.
Pasta: I didn't have high expectations for the pasta but I soon realized that the fresh tomato sauce was amazing. I was very surprised. It must be the secret ingredient. The big shrimps, the big scallops were tender and still juicy.

Dessert: lava cake ! hot and gooey! .There is not many upscale restaurants in the west Island . Towne Hall will give you the young hip ambiance with dj that the younger crowd is looking for a party without going downtown.

The nachos were a bit cold when I arrived, so I can't comment much on them other than the fact that they must have been a mountain before, as there was still a hill left on the half eaten platter.

Upon entered we recognized there seemed to be a mass of confusion in seating people.  We could not tell if you gave your name to a host / hostess and waited to be called or just waited until you were next.  I asked a couple of people in line if you had to give your name and they said no so we just waited.  After a while a squirlley looking old man with greasy hair and a bad suit walked down the line and took everyones name and number in the party.  

We were finally seated and given menus.  The things weighed 5 lbs at least.  It was like being handed the novel ""War and Peace""  and talk about confusing.  I was worn out trying to read the thing and figure out what exactly they had other than their ""famous potatoes"" that seemed to come with every dish.  There was an attempt to group like things together but with all the required French and English versions and the hundreds of combinations of basic breakfast items it made a very confusing pick.  I finally settled on the ham and cheese omellette with a side of bacon with some fresh squeezed orange juice.  My girlfriend had some scrambled eggs / ham / and famous potatoes. 

I found it odd that one waitress took our order then another waitress brought our drinks and yet another one brought our meal.  The portion sizes were way more than one should ever eat in one setting.  There must have been a dozen eggs in the omellete and an overwhelming amount of potatoes.   I will give it to them, the fresh squeezed orange juice was delicious (@ $3.95 per glass it should be)  and the whole wheat toast was pretty good.  Sadly the cheese in the omellette was too salty and the bacon was too salty.  I might as well have just opened the salt shaker and ate out of that.  

The ambience was super noisy.  I could hardly hear my girlfriend talk across the table.  All the while there it looked like the place was a mass of confusion.  They had the orange juice squeezer machine on the front counter so every few minutes you would hear this loud whizzing sound that was really annoying.  

Once it come time to pay, the server is not your cashier.  You have to take your bill to the counter and pay there.  I stood there for over five minutes before someone finally came to take my money.  I saw the same greasy haired guy in the bad suit flitting around wiping everything but he was careful to ignore me standing there at the cash waiting to pay.  Finally, a young lady came to take my payment and she had no idea how to run my credit card.  After explaining to her how to do the transaction we were finally succesful.

Il y avait une petite ligne d'attente a l'intérieur du restaurant mais 3-4 minutes plus tard et nous avions une banquette. Mes œufs bénédictine au brie et portobello était excellent. Servi avec une belle quantité de fruits frais et deux sortes de pommes de terre. 
Ma partenaire a choisi la crêpe aux poires et pommes et semblait heureuse de son choix. 
Le service était efficace et souriant. 
Ce un endroit très occupé donc peut être pas idéal pour un déjeuner intime et tranquille.

If so...Déjeuner Cosmopoitain wins! My eggs were edible, the sausage was pretty standard but the potatoes...over-fried (and dripping in) old stinking grease! The smell permeated my booth and made the meal thoroughly disgusting. One meal here was enough. There's plenty of other mediocre breakfast restaurants in the area.
Speaking of mediocre breakfast restaurants in the area...what's with the number of them that provide no WiFi? The 21st Century is here kids.

For a Sunday after 9:30 of course it's going to be packed.  People are out and about getting breakfast/brunch and this place serves.  Cosmopolitain has a large menu.  To me it's like a better Cora and a more laid back Allo Mon Coco.  I get an old school feel to Le Dejeuner Cosmopolitain and it reminds me very much of a place back home that is very popular with people lining up for a table as well.

I ended up going with a Cosmo delight.  French toast?  Yes.  Bacon, sausage, and ham?  Yes.  Fried potatoes a little bit of fruit and still toast with those eggs?  Oh and baked beans too.  This is better than the Gargantuan at Chez Cora.  This was a full blown breakfast cooked well.

My wife went with an Acapulco which is pancakes, fruit etc.  I liked mine better but hers looked attractive.

The servings are generous and the prices are reasonable.  The service was good as our server came by often to make sure our coffees were never empty.",Le Déjeuner Cosmopolitain,983 Boulevard Saint-Jean,Pointe-Claire,QC,Pointe-ClaireQC,H9R 5K3,45.46954,-73.830393,3.5,13,"Restaurants, Breakfast & Brunch, Canadian (New)"
